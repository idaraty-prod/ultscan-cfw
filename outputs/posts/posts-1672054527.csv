The stipend will support fellows to work on their projects by providing the financial resources necessary to push their idea(s) further. In addition, <strong>each fellow will have access to a budget of up to €2000 for fellowship-related costs, such as mentoring, qualification, and travel expenses</strong>.</p><p>To support and integrate fellows’ networks, each fellow will receive €500 to spend on a Community Flash Grant. With this grant, fellows will be able to support and honour the work of a person or group in their community or communities.</p><p>The fellowship starts in March 2023 and ends in October 2023. In this period of time there will be digital check-ins to connect, share and discuss information on the projects and their processes.

Departing mainly from a critique of western modernity and coloniality which enabled capitalism and subsequent environmental and racial injustice, these forms of critique are not directly applicable to the contexts of Eastern Europe and its states, that were a part of the Soviet modernity that operated within different economical and political models. Situated between imperial powers — coming from Western Europe and the Russian Empire, the lands of these states have been subjected to colonial and neo-colonial gazes that mapped and visualised these territories in their own ways, while rendering them into sites of material transactions and operational spaces where bodies, lands, living and non-living matter were cast as resources. </p><p>Nida Art Colony is looking for cultural practitioners researching the Baltic States to join a two-week residency at <span class=caps>NAC</span> in Nida, Lithuania. The residency will provide participants with the opportunity to connect, exchange and share their practice with a small number of practitioners from Ukraine and the Baltic States. The goal of the residency is to look together at various specific sites — be it the Curonian Spit in Lithuania, Donbas in Ukraine, or approximations, such as Eastern Europe — and to think about the longer histories of sociotechnical imaginaries and spatial arrangements that inscribe themselves in bodies and lands, imagined as a component of material exchange. </p><p>By securing time to be and think together, the intention is to collectively reflect on gaps in knowledge that obscure or mute these territories, their histories, and the material aspects of colonial rendering of these lands into a resource. The goal is to address the sociotechnical arrangements and spatial organisations that enable slow violence and environmental damage while equating the human population and life at large to geological, agricultural, and other forms of matter with usable material capacities. </p><p>Throughout the two weeks participants will share their existing work as well as work-in-progress research with the aim to contribute to a laboratory of practices and ideas through fieldwork, screenings, lectures and discussions. During the residency, a shared vocabulary and bibliography will be developed that supports the production of situated knowledge within these contexts. </p><p>Participant’s contribution throughout the residency: artist talk or lecture, working on an individual project or a collective work-in-progress presentation.</p><p>Participant’s contribution upon completion (by May 2023): a text or a visual essay to be published on the <span class=caps>NAC</span> website.</p><p>Participation is open to professionals working in the field of culture, academic researchers, PhD students and Postdoc researchers with a focus on the Baltic States. <strong><span class=caps>NAC</span> covers travel costs up to 250€</strong> and an individual residency stipend of 800€.</p></div></div></article></div>"

It focuses on objects, practices, environments, and narratives (<span class=caps>OPEN</span>) in their historical, social and historiographical dimensions, including histories of collecting, display, or dispossession, in a conversation that transcends geographical and chronological boundaries. The programme aims to create a space for dialogue for university and museum scholars in order to strengthen transdisciplinary collaborations, to transcend the borders of the 4A disciplines, to combine skills and to foster a conversation between more conceptual and more empirical approaches. The programme aspires to promote transversal networking and critical reflections on historical and contemporary challenges and concerns.</p><p>Applicants should have obtained their master’s degree or their doctorate (within the last seven years prior to their application) in a relevant discipline. Applications are welcome from all regions, with various disciplinary formations, such as Art History, Aesthetics, Archaeology, Anthropology/Ethnology, History and neighbouring fields dealing with artifacts, artistic production, material culture, and aesthetic practices relating to objects, images, languages, architectures, and nature/culture. A reference of the proposed research project to the collections of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation’s institutions is highly welcome. </p><p>The fellowship starts in May 2023 or September 2023 (10 to 15 months). <strong>The fellowships (including travel expenses) follow the guidelines of the Max Planck Society. </strong>Organisational support regarding visas, insurances, housing, etc. will be provided. Successful applicants become 4A_Lab Fellows at the Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz – Max-Planck-Institut and at the Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz and are expected to take up residence in Berlin.

The famous view of the Amont cliff on the English Channel and the arch in the bay of Étretat have inspired masters of Impressionism, writers Guy de Maupassant and Maurice Leblanc, composer Jacques Offenbach, and many others. The residency invites artists to interpret the encounter between the contemporary garden, its architecture, philosophy and history of the site, its natural and artistic heritage, and express it in their final work.

During research-gathering and project planning, the artist is expected to liaise with the team of Les Jardins d’Étretat on site and become familiar with the garden’s rhythm of life: change of seasons, rain and watering, influence of wind, etc. This research will culminate in the delivery of an installation with the artist being present at the opening.</p></div></div></article></div>"

A new building designed by Schenker Salvi Weber Architects will open in 2024 in Altoona Park in the Lower Austrian capital of St. Pölten and is set to become a unique hub for international contemporary art, children, and artists. Geared toward children up to twelve years of age, the new venue will offer two exhibitions a year, a children’s biennial, and a variety of thematically interrelated workshops and projects. </p><p>For young audiences in particular, the quality, event-based character, and topicality of contemporary art productions by international artists have the capacity to set in motion both individual educational processes and socially relevant reflections. What fundamental changes to established art education practices are needed to tap into this potential? With this question in mind, fellows selected by an expert jury will examine the potentialities of contemporary art for and with young audiences.</p><p>The KinderKunstLabor is a learning institution. Experiences and insights from educational processes are applied to the realm of art education and curating in a certification centre developed specifically for this purpose in cooperation with a university network. This is achieved with the RiR through an examination of current discourses and practices that are focused on phenomenological approaches, spatial aspects in art production, curating and art education for and with children. Closely intertwined with this, fellows will conceive and implement qualitatively based research projects that accompany ongoing projects of the KinderKunstLabor.</p><p>The fellowship offers researchers from the <span class=caps>EU</span> active in the fields of contemporary art, curating, and education the opportunity to live and work in St. Pölten for a period of nine months with possible extension. The centre invites researchers with different artistic and theoretical practices to apply. Artistic expertise or experience with aesthetic processes and in-depth knowledge of the art field are a prerequisite. A sound command of the German language is essential. The fellowship is also aimed at students pursuing a doctorate or PhD. Priority will be given to research proposals developed in relation to and in dialogue with the specific, on-the-ground realities of the location. Fellows will have access to institutional infrastructures and are expected to present their findings at an event at the end of their stay.</p><p><strong>The residency includes travel</strong>, accommodation, a stipend, and production costs (for relevant research, printing, or similar expenses). </p></div></div></article></div>"

Its aim is to transform the city into an ideal ecosystem for culture and creativity, harnessing its full potential for global dissemination and international cultural cooperation. Logroño, as the host city of Concéntrico – International Festival of Architecture and Design, will act as a pioneer of the programme in Spain. </p><p>Cities Ahead is launching an open call for international creatives to propose participatory actions for the transformation of the public space, integrating aspects of urban innovation and sustainable/ecological development. This call aims to put the citizens of Logroño at the centre of the city’s future. By implementing a participatory artistic, activist or any other creative action in Logroño, the city will become a vivid marketplace for new ideas, tools and formats. The project puts the initiatives of artists, designers, activists and other creatives in dialogue with the citizens of Logroño. The current challenges of insufficient investments, deterioration of shared values and shrinking public spaces are prevalent in many cities and will be tackled in Logroño through participatory practices that support ecological, economic and social sustainability. Being engaged in the development, production and adoption of public spaces will lead to a greater sense of responsibility and belonging among the citizens.</p><p>The programme will fund innovative and participatory practices with the aim of transforming the public space and helping to make it more creative, humane, sustainable and egalitarian. The proposed practice must be adapted to the local needs of Logroño and its citizens. From all applications, a jury will choose three practices that will be invited to come to Logroño and adapt their practice to the local context. To do so, the creatives will work closely with local stakeholders. The selected proposals will be carried out in Logroño during Concéntrico 09 – International Architecture and Design Festival, which will take place from 27 April - 2 May 2023.</p><p>Each of the selected projects will receive 2000€ as a project fee and <strong>2000€ for the execution of the project on site, which includes a lump sum for travel expenses</strong> and any additional material or development costs.</p></div></div></article></div>"
