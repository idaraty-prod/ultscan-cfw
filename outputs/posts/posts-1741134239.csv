They are intended to encourage the emergence of new ways of formulating, perceiving and using both scientific and artistic research. Through connections between the fields, a better understanding of each respective fields of research will be fostered.The reflections and exchanges will lead to the creation of new works, or the adaptation of pre-existing works that could be integrated with, or adapted to, the experiments conducted in the laboratories, and/or complement them. The results of each residency will be presented at a public event within Campus Biotech or at a partner institution. They could be the subject of a publication in specialized scientific journals.Project Short Description: The relationship between speech rhythmicity and neural oscillations is an important component of speech perception, and especially of comprehension. However, even though the presence of the same rhythm has been described in non-human primates, and neural oscillations are a basic property of animals’ brains, we still do not know how the brain of animals is processing rhythmic information. Therefore, by identifying similarities and differences in rhythm, as well as its connection with brain oscillations in animal species, we hope to uncover the common rules that govern the rhythmic production and processing of vocal signals in animals. These results will help us understand how speech fits or detached itself from these basic rules, giving us new insight into the evolution of language complex hierarchical structure and a better understanding of brains’ perception mechanisms of vocal signals.Lab Work Description: The scientific part of the residency will be supervised by researcher Théophane Piette, who is currently doing his PhD at the NCCR and whose thesis is entitled Animal brains can follow the beat: a cross-species eeg project on the link between brain oscillations and vocalizations rhythm.This PHD is done in the speech and language group, led by Anne-Lise Giraud at Campus Biotech in Geneva. This lab studies the neural bases of language and vocal communication in animals using experimental neurophysiology (PET, fMRI, EEG, MEG, SEEG, ECoG, single spike recordings), computational neuroscience (artificial neural networks, neural signal decoding, dynamical systems modeling), and neurointervention (transcranial electrical stimulation, neurofeedback). Their goal is to uncover the key information processing mechanisms of speech, language as well as animal communication, and use this knowledge to propose targeted treatments in language disorders and better understand the of brains’ perception mechanisms of vocal and rhythmic signals.The residency includes:3 months accommodation in a private room as well as a working space and access to common areas shared with other residents (to be scheduled between October 1st 2024 and February 28th 2025)CHF 1400.- /month as per diemArtistic support provided by EOFAScientific support provided by NCCRPlatform access provided by FCBGCandidates must respond to the following criteria:The open call is addressed to all professional artists coming from following artistic fields: performing arts, visual arts and applied arts (fine arts, music, literature, comics, cinema, dance, theatre, design).The candidate must be in possession of a wide range of creations, publications and performances at a professional level;Not be currently registered in a basic artistic training course;Be over 28 at the time of application;Speak French or English;Accept and agree to pay costs related to their travel and possible artistic production.Application content:Document 1: Application Questionnaire fully completed with Adobe Acrobat.Document 2: Application File in PDF format, maximum 15 pages (FR or ENG) including:A cover letterDescription of the project to be developed in GenevaPortfolio of recent workRecent CVThe completed questionnaire, fully completed with Adobe Acrobat, and your application file must be sent separately in the same email ([email protected]) in PDF format before the 15th of September 2024, at midnight, local time (UTC+2).Applications exceeding the page limit or incomplete will not be presented to the jury.","","","<div class=""field field--name-field-body field--type-entity-reference-revisions field--label-hidden field__items""><div class=field__item> <div class=""paragraph paragraph--type--text paragraph--view-mode--full""><div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-paragraph-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item""><p><a href=https://www.eofa.ch target=_blank>The Embassy of Foreign Artists</a> (EOFA) residency programme is partnering with<a href=https://fcbg.ch target=_blank> Foundation Campus Biotech Geneva</a> (FCBG) to offer the opportunity to apply for research and production residencies for a project linked with the work of the <a href=https://evolvinglanguage.ch/ target=_blank>Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) Evolving Language</a>.</p><p><a href=https://www.eofa.ch/en/open-call-2024-2025/ target=_blank>The purpose of the call</a> is to offer residencies to professional artists from all fields (visual arts, dance, theatre, music, writing, comic books, film, etc.), whose project would take inspiration from the cutting-edge research conducted by the partner laboratories active within Campus Biotech.</p><p>The goal of these residencies is to promote exchanges and intersections between scientific practices and artistic practices.

As a home for visual artists, designers and digital creators, Nocefresca offers solo artists, collectives or small groups a growth retreat experience for a period of one to three months on the island of Sardinia.Stemming from an exploration of the artists' practices and interests, Nocefresca designs a tailored programme of activities that reflects the unique locations and creative opportunities available in Sardinia. This allows participants to delve into their work as a self-directed experience with weekly opportunities to engage with the other residents and local community through collective activities, conversations, workshops, explorations of the local cultural scene, visiting guests and much more.By inviting a limited number of artists in areas far from the tourist coasts, Nocefresca creates a sustainable experience able to contribute to the territory and support it in the periods when it experiences less tourist flow and it is, therefore, more authentic and calm.The 2024 Open Call is for a residency spot. Your stay takes place November 20 - December 18 2024, and is primarily self-directed and, as an artist, you are expected to be self-sufficient in your practice.

During this chat, she is also available to discuss in detail any needs participants have regarding their studio space, accommodation, equipment, and so forth.The assistant curator is always present in Milis functioning as the main reference point. Their role is essential if participants need support in finding specific kinds of equipment or materials, navigating conversations with someone who doesn't speak English, and much more. They both pay regular visits to participants' studios to support them through conversations and feedback.At Nocefresca, artists are free to develop their own projects without any restriction regarding topic or outcome. As a curatorial choice, every year they pick a theme upon which they establish a plan of activities. On one hand, this helps share with the artists and the public a coherent one-year-long experience; on the other, it allows the organizers to create an inspiring and harmonious program. The topics focus always on the relationship among humans, nature, and the future and intertwine both local and universal interests, such as botany, agriculture, food, landscape, community, sustainability, history, anthropology, culture, and more.]The artists in residence will have access to the following amenities and facilities included in the residency fee:HousingEquipment and gearsCuratorial assistanceStudio and meeting roomInsurancePlanned activities and eventsUse of the outdoor courtyardBikeArchive publicationThrough Nocefresca, participants have the chance to become authentic temporary inhabitants of Sardinian rural villages thanks to the network of locals supporting the project.

After its closure, known then as ""Spreepark"", the sidebecame derelict and was reclaimed by nature. Now it hosts exhibitions, open-air installations, and educational programms that investigate the close relationship between people and nature, art and forest.Just next door to the Spreepark, four apartments with adjoining studios have been created for a group of four artists. They are housed within the historic Eierhäuschen - a newly renovated and re-opened building dating back to the 19th century. There is a shared spacious common room and communal kitchen, located directly above the exhibition spaces and offices of the Spreepark ArtSpace as well as the adjacent beer garden and restaurant. The close neighbourhood enables a lively exchange with the curatorial team and the broad audience.In 2025, the residency space will host four resident groups for approximately 3 months at a time. In addition to the complimentary accommodation, they cover the costs of travel and provide a fixed financial contribution to the living costs of EUR 3,600 net per person.The focus of the programme is the sustainable connection between art and nature for a varied audience. They would like to welcome a diverse collective that explore these topics and consists of visual artists and members of non-artistic disciplines. The organisers are particularly interested in the fields of urban development and planning, architecture, urbanism and all ecological disciplines. The group can also form specifically for the residency programme, but the members should already know each other well enough to be comfortable working and living together for the residency period.

Also, in individual cases, they are happy to offer advice on possible alternatives if you need accommodation for your children, as the Eierhäuschen unfortunately is not able to accommodate children. For applicants from non-European countries, they will assist in arranging entry visas for the duration of your stay. They also warmly welcome people with impairments or disabilities. In each case, they offer a safe space to discuss and provide individual considerations and special requirements.The focus of this residency is on analysing and exploring the Spreepark as a living space of transformation.

Witt Residency Program is to support the production of new work at the University of Michigan. The program awards one residency per academic year for a visiting artist/​designer to develop a new work in collaboration with the Stamps School and University of Michigan community. To make visible the creative process through the creation of a defined work from concept to completion, is a central tenet of the residency. The residency is expected to culminate in the realization of the proposed work, as well as its presentation.The 2024 – 2025 Witt Residency is organized in partnership with the Stamps Gallery, a public center for contemporary art and design in downtown Ann Arbor, part of the Stamps School of Art & Design, at the University of Michigan. The Stamps Gallery opened in 2017 after years of being located in three disparate campus spaces. Building on the school’s strong tradition of excellence, thought leadership, and community engagement, the goal is to develop innovative and scholarly exhibitions, publications, and public programs that foster inclusive platforms for presentation, discussion, and inquiry into the urgent questions and concerns of our time. The Gallery is an incubator and lab for contemporary artists and designers to explore ideas and projects that catalyze positive social change. A commitment to social justice informs the work of developing exhibitions, programs, and publications with a goal to inspire new ways of looking, making, and thinking. Stamps Gallery also partners with faculty and students to develop and present exhibitions and programs that examine the potential role of art & design to create a more just and equitable community.The residency will consist of a making period of up to 12 weeks in residence during the 2024 – 2025 academic year, followed by an exhibition period. The culminating exhibition will open early in the fall of 2025 and will occupy the Stamps Gallery— with possibilities for additional programming to extend beyond the gallery space. Plans should show consistency conceptually regarding the inherent overall structure of the project, have a strong visual impact and potential for engagement. This, along with the proposed work, will strongly determine the selection of the artist/​designer.The Witt Residency is open to both established and emerging artists/​designers. The residency provides students an alternate learning opportunity to engage with practicing artists/​designers who can make use of resources across campus, therefore the ideal candidate must value collaboration, have good social and communication skills and be interested in generating creative partnerships across disciplines. It is the goal of the Witt Residency to foster an atmosphere of inventive creative activity that extends throughout the University community. Witt Residents receive an honorarium of $20,000 for up to twelve weeks in residence served over an academic year. In addition to the honorarium, residents will be provided with housing, studio space, and up to $5,000 funding support for project materials. The School encourages applications from individuals as well as from creative teams however, please be advised that the resources listed above are finite, including the travel budget. If teams apply the expectation is that the award will be shared between its members. The deadline for applying is 15 February 2024. The application is done online via SlideRoom. SlideRoom requires a nominal $15 application fee to offset the cost of media uploads and storage at the time of submission. The fee is paid by the applicant using a secure system via SlideRoom online as the final step in submitting the application.

The residency is connected to Tjolöholm Castle in Kungsbacka, at the Swedish west coast, with a relationship to Nordic and Celtic folklore, reflected in both the breathtaking natural surroundings and the impressive castle interiors. In a time characterized by advanced weaponry, ‘fake news’, conspiracy theories, extreme weather, selfies, screens – speed and affect – ensouled nature, the spiritual and magical world seems to have taken on new meaning that tempts our fantasies and needs in the search for our inner selves. Global mobilization in the face of environmental and climatic threats, along with a growing longing for a life in harmony with nature, have meant that the forest and its inhabitants’ mystique, knowledge, and power have become a sought-after refuge – far from the din of city life. Mythological and magical beings’ re-emerging presence crosses the boundaries of reality’s possibilities and points toward new queer worlds in which gender roles, perceptions of good and evil, beautiful and ugly, and us and Others stand to be dissolved.With the artistic residency Forgotten Realms, Art Inside Out wants to invite artists to explore the irrational, fantastic and magical in our lives through various forms of artistic investigations. The location - Tjolöholm Castle, Kungsbacka, built from 1898 to 1904 under the direction of Blanche Dickson, was created to be its own realm from the very beginning. It is designed as a British estate with inspiration from the Arts & Crafts movement and qualities of National Romanticism, drawn by a young Swedish architect who had never set foot in the British Isles. Situated on a peninsula in Kungsbacka Fjord along the west coast of Sweden, surrounded by dense forests with a view for miles over the Halland archipelago, its unique architecture has allowed Tjolöholm to serve as the stage for stories such as Lars von Trier’s film Melancholia, in which a struggle against the realization of the end of the world is reinforced by the castle’s dark, brooding silhouette. Since 2022, the castle has been on the European Film Academy’s list of significant sites in film history. Submissions from international artists in an interdisciplinary field of contemporary artistic production are welcome. The residency schedule is as follows: research March 11–24, production Maj 15–June 20. The artworks created during the residency will be presented in an exhibition at Tjolöholm Castle opening by mid-June 2023.Each residency artist will receive a sum of 100 000 SEK (F-taxable, exclusive VAT, paid by invoice) for an 8-week long residency. Each artist also has access to a production budget of approximately 50 000 SEK. There is also an additional budget for installation and other exhibition-related costs available. The artist is responsible for paying applicable taxes in their home country. (To avoid paying taxes also in Sweden, every non-Swedish citizen needs to apply to be exempted from the taxation (30% of the promised sum). The application will be sent to the Swedish tax office, if/after the artist has been selected to the residency.)Art Inside Out covers associated costs such as travel (two trips, to and from residency according to the residency schedule), housing, workspaces and process management. The artists will have the opportunity to work independently and together. Public meetings, such as artist talks, will be held regularly throughout the residency.Residency artists will live in shared and self-sufficient households with their own rooms at a location in Kungsbacka municipality, close to but not at Tjolöholm Castle itself. This means that daily trips between the accommodation and the workplace will occur. A driver's license is a preferred, but not required.The application is online with a deadline October 26, 2023 (23:59 CET). Decisions will be announced in December 2023.","","","<div class=""field field--name-field-body field--type-entity-reference-revisions field--label-hidden field__items""><div class=field__item> <div class=""paragraph paragraph--type--text paragraph--view-mode--full""><div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-paragraph-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item""><p>Art Inside Out invites artist applications for participation in Forgotten Realms, an artistic residency that explores new representations of reality in the borderland between the mundane and the fantastical, myth and reality, past and present.

La Wayaka Current's programme Desert 23°S presents a rare opportunity to research and develop your creative practice inside an oasis in one of the driest environments on their planet. This region more closely resembles the surface of Mars than Earth, offers the most optimal conditions for astronomical observations in the world, and preserves ancient archaeological sites beneath the sand.They are committed to creating a space in which artists-in-residence can explore contemporary socio-political concerns and current threats to the environment through their practice. Their fluid, site-responsive programme introduces artists-in-residence to the local ecology, history, and culture of this territory, cultivating spaces in remote environments that nourish and encourage space for personal and professional growth. They cultivate experiential nodes of learning with a focus on research and experimentation to manifest inspiration in an outdoor creative space, beyond a conventional studio context.La Wayaka Current is open to all kinds of creators, artists, cultural practitioners, writers, musicians, scientists, activists, as well as professionals from other fields, from across the globe, who wish to engage with urgent ecological issues of their time through creative projects in new contexts. Their residency programmes offer a place to connect to territories and explore new ideas in the form of research, creative projects, and artistic experimentation.Their curated programmes allow participants to inhabit unique environments, learn experientially from the land, connect to local contexts, and explore pressing issues of their time. They aim to support the creation of new artistic work and dialogues that navigate a time of planetary mass extinction, and ecological and climatic crises while building meaningful relationships and reciprocity towards each other and the planet. They always strive to include diverse perspectives and involve indigenous collaborators through their programming.For their programme in the Atacama Desert, they challenge participants to investigate new perspectives in art and ecology through connections to this region. For the duration of the 3-week period, La Wayaka Current will lead a curated programme with around half of the time being immersive and guided, and the other half independent and self-directed.The programme consists of a series of activities and guided research trips to inform and expand their understanding of this region. This includes cultural encounters, research excursions, guided talks, and activities that aim to connect artists to the biodiversity in experiential ways and specifically to the Andean cosmology of the Altiplano, a culture that has developed here over the last 15,000 years. They encourage reflections and conversations that bring awareness to the deeper complexities and problematics that exist here in the driest region on earth, addressing the context of colonisation, and climate change, as well as local extractivism and water-intensive mining practices.Outside of the immersive programme period, there is time to go deeper into their self-directed practice at the base or go on self-guided trips in the area. From the residency base, they are strategically based for participants to access the open Desert and the Andean Steppe with wetlands, canyons, hot springs, geysers, salt flats, lakes, volcanoes, and rivers to explore in the area. To make self-guided trips outside of the programme, they offer bikes, and for further distances, they can also offer advice and connections to transport and local guide service, for any other specific research catered to their interests that they wish to do outside of their offered programme.Applications are currently open to join for a minimum of 3 weeks during the following time periods:2023:6th September to 27th September 20235th October to 26th October 20232nd November to 23rd November 20232024:9th March to 30th March 20245th April to 26th April 20243rd May to 24th May 20246th September to 27th September 20245th October to 26th October 20242nd November to 23rd November 2024They currently offer financial aid, advice in seeking funding from other institutions in their PDF, work-exchange opportunities, and bursaries on all their programs.

The integration of artistic thinking and knowledge as reflective practices in their own right is an important dimension of the Institute’s mission. For this the presence of art and the inspiration and challenge of artistic practice are essential.

Joya: AiR offers abundant time and space for residents to make, think, explore and learn from their surroundings. Joya: AiR supports a range of disciplines including, but not limited to, visual art, writing, music, dance, curatorial and film. Founded and curated by Simon and Donna Beckmann in 2009, the Joya: arte + ecología / AiR programme is grounded in the foundation that dynamic and sustainable creative activity is the backbone to regenerating the land that has been slowly abandoned over the last fifty years.
Since 2006, Joya: AiR has welcomed over 1500+ artists and creatives to realise their projects within one of the most unique and beautiful regions of the country. This is one of the sunniest regions of Europe receiving over 3000 hours of sunlight a year.
Residents have access to individual studio space and 20 hectares of land. Accommodation (private room with attached bathroom) and meals are included, as is the collection and return to the nearest public transport system. Selected artists are invited to contribute to the Joya: artists listing and are asked to contribute a small text outlining the nature of their practice whilst in residency. This will be posted to the Joya: website along with a link to the artists' website (examples are to be found here). Selected artists are requested to make a presentation of their work to other artists in residence during their period at Joya: AiR. This is not obligatory but it does contribute to the overall experience of all artists in residence. Joya’s working languages are English and Spanish. The length of the residency would be 1 to 2 weeks (longer periods are available). The Joya: AiR residency has a fee of €365 per week + tax (10%).

Based on a very open field of action (exact sciences, human sciences, environment, space research, astrophysics, neurosciences, etc.), the aim is to create an innovative space where artists and scientists can share, exchange and mutually enrich each other, giving rise to practices and forms of expression that are neither purely ""scientific"" nor purely ""artistic"".
The project aims to: Promote the work of visual artists who are interested in the sciences in one way or another, whether to question them as such, to question their practices or to make use of technological advances and scientific methods in their artistic production. Encourage the creation of science-related works. Facilitate artists' access to science and research. Raise awareness of scientific practices of all kinds. To raise public awareness of the reciprocal permeability of scientific and artistic approaches. The artist will carry out the residency in close collaboration with a research laboratory or various scientists at the University of Liège. Given the necessary collaborative dimension of the project, the artist-scientist duo will be validated after a first meeting and on the basis of mutual consent (concerning the procedure, the collaboration and the aims) between the artist, the scientist(s) and the project leaders. The choice and the conditions of the public restitution (work, exhibition, public presentation...) of the residency will be left to the discretion of the artist in agreement with the scientist(s) and the project organisers. A precise timetable establishing the various phases of the residency will be drawn up with the artist at the start of the residency.
The institution occupies a unique place in the world of museum institutions. Not only is it an open-air museum, set in an exceptional architectural and natural environment, but it is also a free museum-accessible 24 hours a day, open to the whole community, without any restrictions. In addition to this commitment to cultural democratisation, the Musée en plein air is also committed to preserving the works in its collection, expanding it through new acquisitions and promoting contemporary art through temporary exhibitions.
The total duration of two months. Dates to be agreed with the artist between 1 September and 15 December 2023. The duration of the residency may be continuous or divided into several stays. The presentation of the results (in whatever form) must also take place or begin during this period.
Location: ULiège campus, Sart Tilman, Liège, Belgium
The artist commits to: Devote himself/herself to the project and remain at the residency site for most of the planned duration. Do everything possible to collaborate with the scientist(s). Propose a public presentation (work, exhibition, presentation, etc.) no later than the last day of the residency, i.e. 15 December 2023. Make himself/herself available to co-lead courses or creative workshops to be defined with the project organisers (at least 2 days during the residency). Make himself/herself available to meet partners or players from the artistic, cultural and scientific worlds during the residency. Report regularly (at least twice a month) to the project organisers on the progress of the residency. Since research, collaboration and process are key here, the residency may be a working stage in research that has already begun or is in its infancy, without the artist being expected to produce a definitive and fully completed project. However, a public presentation (work, exhibition, presentation, etc.) presenting the results of the residency is expected.
The artist receives: Accommodation during the residency.The specific terms and conditions of accommodation and travel will be communicated to the artist at a later date. A large workspace on the premises of the Musée en plein air, at the heart of the Sart Tilman campus. Artistic fees for a total of €4,000 gross for the artistic activities (artist residency, co-organisation of courses or creative workshops and public presentation). The fees will be paid by the Musée en plein air on the basis of an invoice or legal request for payment issued by the artist.A per diem of €30 per day of effective residence. Travel between the artist's home and Liège will be reimbursed up to a maximum of €500 including a tax on presentation of receipts. Travel during the residency period (excluding travel between home and the residency) is reimbursed up to a maximum of €250 including the tax on the presentation of receipts. The workshop made available to the artist is not equipped, with the exception of tables and chairs. The artist must therefore come equipped with his or her own working tools or obtain them. The cost of consumables and materials required for the residency, the public presentation and the creative workshops will be covered up to a maximum of €3,000 including tax.
To apply, submit:A written presentation of the project, maximum 3 pages, including in particular:A description of the residency project and the proposed final presentationMention and explanation of the interest in one or more fields of scientific researchA description of the working methodology envisaged, in particular for the collaboration with the scientists The artist's curriculum vitaeAn artistic portfolio including examples of works already completed, exhibition views, texts, press reviews, etc.A copy of the artist's identity document. All applications must be submitted in French or English.
The application must be sent by email to the following address: [email protected]
The deadline for applications is midnight (Brussels time) on 15 July 2023.
A confirmation of receipt will be sent by email within one week of receiving the application. Only complete applications submitted by the deadline will be accepted.
Partners: Réjouisciences is ULiège's department for disseminating scientific and technological culture. Its objectives are to share and animate the knowledge produced within the university and to disseminate science and technology to the general public, while implementing new and effective methods of mediation. Here Art&fact (guides and lecturers with degrees in art history) is the main educational partner of the Musée en plein air, taking charge of guided tours, organising courses for children, and writing educational and playful publications for a wide range of audiences. Here, the association is responsible for organising courses and workshops for children and teenagers in connection with the residency project and in collaboration with the artist.","","","<div class=""field field--name-field-body field--type-entity-reference-revisions field--label-hidden field__items""><div class=field__item> <div class=""paragraph paragraph--type--text paragraph--view-mode--full""><div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-paragraph-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item""><p style=""font:13.0px 'Helvetica Neue';margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;""><a href=https://www.museepla.uliege.be/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Call-residency-arts-and-sciences-2023-EN.pdf target=_blank>The residency project</a>, initiated by the Musée en plein air du Sart Tilman, aims to create a space for reflection and the creation of works on the theme of the possible relationship between the arts and sciences, through an original scheme combining artistic creation, scientific research and cultural mediation.<span class=Apple-converted-space> </span>Based on a very open field of action (exact sciences, human sciences, environment, space research, astrophysics, neurosciences, etc.), the aim is to create an innovative space where artists and scientists can share, exchange and mutually enrich each other, giving rise to practices and forms of expression that are neither purely ""scientific"" nor purely ""artistic"".<span class=Apple-converted-space> </span></p><p style=""font:13.0px 'Helvetica Neue';margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;""> </p><p style=""font:13.0px 'Helvetica Neue';margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"">The project aims to:<span class=Apple-converted-space> </span></p><ul><li><p style=""font:13.0px 'Helvetica Neue';margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"">Promote the work of visual artists who are interested in the sciences in one way or another, whether to question them as such, to question their practices or to make use of technological advances and scientific methods in their artistic production. </p></li><li><p style=""font:13.0px 'Helvetica Neue';margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"">Encourage the creation of science-related works. </p></li><li><p style=""font:13.0px 'Helvetica Neue';margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"">Facilitate artists' access to science and research. </p></li><li><p style=""font:13.0px 'Helvetica Neue';margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"">Raise awareness of scientific practices of all kinds. </p></li><li><p style=""font:13.0px 'Helvetica Neue';margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"">To raise public awareness of the reciprocal permeability of scientific and artistic approaches.<span class=Apple-converted-space> </span></p></li></ul><p style=""font:13.0px 'Helvetica Neue';margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"">The artist will carry out the residency in close collaboration with a research laboratory or various scientists at the University of Liège.

Instead of merely documenting the climate catastrophe through documentary photography (and thereby even contributing to a paralysing sense of hopelessness), Hydromedia: Seeing with Water encourages artists to develop new and enticing protocols for rethinking and reshaping the relationship between humans and nature. In collaboration with environmentalists and scientists, new methods and tools are to be created during individual residencies at research sites in Antwerp (BE), Utrecht (NL) and Karlsruhe (DE). Twelve selected fellows will be part of this project co-funded by the E.U. (Creative Europe).
The third artist-in-residence program Hydromedia: Seeing With Water Karlsruhe proposes to sidestep conventional visual approaches to global warming. They invite established artists and designers to submit a proposal to develop innovative and hands-on tools during a one-month residency in April 2024 at the University of Arts and Design (HfG) Karlsruhe and in their own studio in the months after. You may extend an already existing practice or propose to make new work about the theme.
The guiding theme is water and the residency will be multidisciplinary. You explore your preferred angle to this theme within local settings. During the residency, you will also be offered the possibility to collaborate with (or get inspired by) the work of scientists and ecologists around water and ecological water management.
The organisation invites you to explore and develop innovative ways of looking at (or with) water by using analogue and/or digital media. The creative process must be documented and processed into an artistic protocol, so the work will give a wider audience the tools to reimagine their relationship to nature.
The Hydromedia program consists of three residency periods (four selected artists per residency): The Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp (BE) in April 2023, the Utrecht University of the Arts (HKU) in Utrecht (NL) in October 2023, and the University of Arts and Design in Karlsruhe (DE) in April 2024. Within a few months after each residency, there willbe a small exhibition in the vicinity of the residency location showing the works as developed during and shortly after the residency period.
In fall 2024 the work of all 12 participants will be shown together in a curated group show at the Dresden Museum of Technology and Industry (Germany). This is the open call for the third residency period, at the University of Arts and Design in Karlsruhe (HfG) in Karlsruhe (Germany) in April 2024. Four artists will be selected per residency location. Each artist receives a € 2000 fee, a € 2000 working budget, as well as reimbursement of travel costs. Accommodation and subsistence fees will also be provided.
The area of Karlsruhe (Baden-Württemberg) has a long history of paper production, printing and photography, which are reliant on local water management. But the growing droughts in the Black Forest region (one of the densest forests in Germany) are exacerbating to the point of drinking water shortage, even though it is still commonly known for its mineral and thermal baths and spas. In Baden-Württemberg, there are still only a few rivers in a desirable state. In many places, floodplains have been built up, streams and bends have been straightened or drained, and weirs, dams and barrages often prevent fish from migrating. Regular flooding reveals what the loss of near-natural river courses and floodplains has to do with flooding. In Karlsruhe, the selected resident artists will work in the upper Rhine area, which is characterised by the valley between the Black Forest and the Vosges. The Rhine is one of the busiest waterways in the world. Its estuaries in the Netherlands reach the North Sea, of which it is the most water-rich tributary. Karlsruhe is adjoining the Upper Rhine area. Underneath it flows an even more powerful stream, which is the largest groundwater reservoir in Europe. Nonetheless, this region suffers increasingly from drought due to the lack of sustainable water management. The resident artists are invited to investigate the reasons for this massive groundwater waste and discuss improvements for a sustainable use and smarter water drainage. In the Upper Rhine Valley, small rivers full of groundwater rise from springs in the middle of the plain. AroundKarlsruhe, there are numerous quarry ponds that are filled with these ground waters and many arms of the Rhine, which are under nature protection. Through the straightening of the river, many floodplain forests have arisen. With its proximity to this river and its wide valley floor, the summers in the region of Karlsruhe are exceptionally warm. This leads to an unusual, nearly tropical climate, which is favourable for cultivation, but causes high levels of evaporation. What used to be the warmest region in Germany is becoming the hottest region and a climate crisis area. Dehydration as well as the groundwaters are hardly visible, therefore it is even more necessary to highlight these problems within the local communities.
During their stay in Karlsruhe, artists will not only have time to investigate the local water situation, but develop and/or adjust their artistic practice to the site-specific conditions. HfG supplies plenty of workshops and art facilities. The Bio Design Lab at HfG, NABU (Naturschutzbund), ZKM (Center for Art and Media) and KIT (Institute for Technology Karlsruhe) will be close partners in this process to support the residents with information through workshops and lectures. After the residency period, the selected artists will have some time to further develop their work, which will be shown in a local exhibition after the residency period in July 2024. After that, they will have more time to process the research period and exhibition experiences to prepare for a second exhibition in fall 2024 in Dresden.
Detailed information about the workshops and lectures during the residency period, as well as the local exhibition in Karlsruhe, will be communicated before the beginning of the residency phase. There will be an online meeting, to get to know the co-participants and the Hydromedia project team of Karlsruhe. This date will be organised depending on the availability of the selected artists.
The deadline to apply for the residency in Karlsruhe is set for 30 July 2023, 12:00 CET (noon). Applications after this deadline will not be considered. Please apply via email to [email protected]. Attachments larger than 2MB should be sent via a WeTransfer link or permanent link to an online drive (e.g. google, dropbox, Mega).
Please hand in: a description of your Hydromedia project, taking into account the media and tools you will be using as well as the site-specificities of your approach, a letter of motivation (max. 500 words) in which you describe the low-tech tools you want to develop, that will engage a wider audience with the local water problems.a portfolio of selected works, your CV and a short bio (max. 200 words) Applicants will be notified within two weeks after the deadline has closed about the results. You will not receive a receipt of the submitted application. Conditions of participation:You are an active artist residing in an E.U. member state or nation that participates in the Creative Europe program. You are fluent in English and able to collaborate with others during the project. You are present and active during the entire period of the residency. You will be able to present the results of your residency in both the local exhibition and the final exhibition in Dresden in the fall of 2024. You are willing to share your working methods with the general public (via the paper publications that will be launched during the exhibitions) and provide the team with representative documentation for the project’s website and social media before, during and after the residency period. You are able to attend the opening days of the local exhibitions of the first two stages of the Hydromedia program, in Antwerp on 22 & 23 September 2023 and in Utrecht in mid-February 2024. Travel and accommodation will be provided.","","","<div class=""field field--name-field-body field--type-entity-reference-revisions field--label-hidden field__items""><div class=field__item> <div class=""paragraph paragraph--type--text paragraph--view-mode--full""><div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-paragraph-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item""><p style=""font:13.0px 'Helvetica Neue';margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"">Polluted oceans and melting glaciers, rainstorms and arid landscapes: all climate change processes are linked to water.

But the growing droughts in the Black Forest region (one of the densest forests in Germany) are exacerbating to the point of drinking water shortage, even though it is still commonly known for its mineral and thermal baths and spas. In Baden-Württemberg, there are still only a few rivers in a desirable state. In many places, floodplains have been built up, streams and bends have been straightened or drained, and weirs, dams and barrages often prevent fish from migrating. Regular flooding reveals what the loss of near-natural river courses and floodplains has to do with flooding.</p><p style=""font:13.0px 'Helvetica Neue';margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;""> </p><p style=""font:13.0px 'Helvetica Neue';margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"">In Karlsruhe, the selected resident artists will work in the upper Rhine area, which is characterised by the valley between the Black Forest and the Vosges. The Rhine is one of the busiest waterways in the world. Its estuaries in the Netherlands reach the North Sea, of which it is the most water-rich tributary. Karlsruhe is adjoining the Upper Rhine area. Underneath it flows an even more powerful stream, which is the largest groundwater reservoir in Europe. Nonetheless, this region suffers increasingly from drought due to the lack of sustainable water management. The resident artists are invited to investigate the reasons for this massive groundwater waste and discuss improvements for a sustainable use and smarter water drainage.</p><p style=""font:13.0px 'Helvetica Neue';margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;""> </p><p style=""font:13.0px 'Helvetica Neue';margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"">In the Upper Rhine Valley, small rivers full of groundwater rise from springs in the middle of the plain.

Through the straightening of the river, many floodplain forests have arisen. With its proximity to this river and its wide valley floor, the summers in the region of Karlsruhe are exceptionally warm. This leads to an unusual, nearly tropical climate, which is favourable for cultivation, but causes high levels of evaporation. What used to be the warmest region in Germany is becoming the hottest region and a climate crisis area. Dehydration as well as the groundwaters are hardly visible, therefore it is even more necessary to highlight these problems within the local communities.<span class=Apple-converted-space> </span></p><p style=""font:13.0px 'Helvetica Neue';margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;""> </p><p style=""font:13.0px 'Helvetica Neue';margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"">During their stay in Karlsruhe, artists will not only have time to investigate the local water situation, but develop and/or adjust their artistic practice to the site-specific conditions. HfG supplies plenty of workshops and art facilities.

It could encompass air, water, soil, noise, light, or any other form of pollution affecting our environment and communities. It could seek to examine the causes, consequences, and potential solutions related to pollution. It could also look at complex ways our systems are connected and how we can improve in areas such as urban planning and farming.In Chiang Mai, there are particular challenges with air pollution, due to things such as vehicles, factories, construction, garden burning, and agricultural and forest fires. Therefore, as part of the residency, they will be visiting RUEE Lab (Rajamangala University of Technology Lanna), which researches the measurement, control and prevention of pm2.5 pollution. You don’t have to be an expert in air pollution, rather they are interested in seeing how creative approaches can contribute diverse perspectives to pollution and scientific processes.

From September 2023 to June 2024, MASSIA will host 6 individual practitioners and 2 collectives for residencies ranging from 1-2 months, supported by the Nordic-Baltic Mobility Programme for Culture.This call is for individual and collective proposals that relate to the specific context of MASSIA: a context in which a deep curiosity for ecology goes hand-in-hand with a commitment to experiments in self-organisation. We are looking for practitioners who have the desire and capacity to re-think and care for the reproductional sphere (that is, the sphere of human and non-human labour that maintains life for ourselves and others in shared ecologies) through their artistic practices. Diversity, pro-activity, complexity and radical experimentation are welcome, as are many other things we cannot imagine yet – so please surprise us!Residents are invited to follow their individual working processes with the option of developing collaborative projects, reflections and research with fellow residents while immersing themselves in the multispecies ecologies that MASSIA is part of and situated within. The program facilitates opportunities to connect with local people and places through organised visits and field trips, as well as offering a platform for, and assistance with, sharing working processes with relevant communities and audiences.The SPROUT program seeks to foster sustainable artistic working conditions.

In return, we ask you to consider the time and energy of the MASSIA members who will be assessing applications when deciding on the form and length of your submission.For the selection process they would like to get a sense of:• who you are as a person and as a practitioner• questions/ideas/practices you will bring with you to the residency• how your practice relates to the thematic scope of the SPROUT program• how the conditions offered by MASSIA and the SPROUT program would benefit you and your practice• how you relate to the ideas and practices that MASSIA is engaged with and outlines on its websitePlease send your application by 2nd July 2023 (Midnight EEST) to [email protected] with the subject line “MASSIA SPROUT_residency date of your choice”If you have questions you can send an email with the subject line “MASSIA SPROUT_question” to [email protected]. SELECTION PROCESS:A group of MASSIA co-organisers will make a selection of residents whose work resonate with and enter into multifaceted dialogue with one another. We hope to bring together practices that will support and inform one another, and to foster discussions and interactions between residents with different cultural, educational, and socio-economic backgrounds, identities, and ways of thinking.This process will be guided by:• The content of the applications• Whether MASSIA can meet the needs of the applicants• How applications resonate with one another• How applications resonate with MASSIA’s valuesUnfortunately, they will not be able to provide individual feedback for each application.This program is specifically offered to practitioners based in Nordic and Baltic countries – in this case, Baltic countries other than Estonia. Please note that this does not mean you need to be a citizen of one of these countries. The places of residence which fall within the framework of this program are Åland, Denmark, the Faroe Islands, Finland, Greenland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, and Sweden.MASSIA is an artist-run, self-organised residency space in rural Estonia, inviting residents to motorize their own capacity to (co)create the desired conditions for creating work and producing knowledge. Alongside developing their own practice, residents are invited to participate in collective practices, exchange and collaboration. The conceptual as well as structural conditions prevailing at MASSIA make it possible for generative conviviality among residents.MASSIA is open for self-directed residencies – at low cost, without a selection process or the pressure to produce outcomes – all year round, and can host up to 40 residents at any one time. SPROUT residents are invited to continue using MASSIA as a project- and residency space after the end of their program, enabling the growth of structures, including networks and multispecies constellations, for long-term collaboration. Residents are also welcome to participate in the collective organisation of MASSIA.MASSIA is based in the Estonian countryside near the Baltic Sea, about 180 km south of Tallinn and 140 km north of Riga, Latvia. The residency is situated in a heritage school building in a small village surrounded by forests, fields and wetlands. Nigula, one of Estonia’s oldest bog reserves, starts 5km away. In Kabli, 12 kilometres to the west, you will find the long sandy beaches of the Baltic Sea.The building is surrounded by 2 hectares of garden offering the possibility to engage with natureculture practices. The nearby forests attract mushroom pickers and plant foragers throughout the year. MASSIA also maintains a herb laboratory with an extensive medicinal herb collection and library which are open for study and experimentation.Residents are welcome to bring their families. How much space MASSIA can offer for this will depend on the particular residency period you apply for. We ask that you inquire with us in advance. The program has a small budget reserved for residents bringing their children. Any other person you wish to bring along is welcome to stay at the regular conditions MASSIA offers.MASSIA is home to Dandylion the cat, who doesn’t accept non-human others within what they consider their territory. Residents therefore cannot bring their animal relatives with them to MASSIA.","","","<div class=""field field--name-field-body field--type-entity-reference-revisions field--label-hidden field__items""><div class=field__item> <div class=""paragraph paragraph--type--text paragraph--view-mode--full""><div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-paragraph-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item""><p>SPROUT complements MASSIA’s self-organised open-residency model through fully funded opportunities for artists and cultural practitioners who work at the intersection of art and ecology and are based in a Nordic or a Baltic country.

In the world of today, marked by constant challenges and uncertainties, the need for care has become increasingly important. Take Care is an urgent call to recognize the interconnectedness of their lives and to embrace the responsibility they have towards one another and their context/environment. Its theme resonates deeply within the realm of contemporary performative practices, theatre, and dramaturgy, inviting them to explore the profound significance of what care is or could be in their world now.The arts can serve as a powerful medium for reflection, empathy, and transformation. Through the lens of contemporary performative practices, theatre, and dramaturgy, they can delve into the complexities of their human existence and unveil narratives that foster care, empathy, and social consciousness. The notion of ""Take Care"" urges them to question, provoke, and reimagine how they relate to themselves, each other, and the world they live in.Within this context, their long-term curatorial approach seeks to create a space that nurtures both artists and audiences, offering a sanctuary for exploration, contemplation, and healing. It invites artists, theatre makers, and dramaturgs to delve into the multidimensional concept of care, embracing its diverse manifestations and highlighting the urgency to integrate care into their creative processes, narratives, and interactions.""Take Care"" encourages artists to examine the intricate relationships between care, power dynamics, vulnerability, and resilience. It prompts them to explore how care can be both an act of resistance and a transformative force within the performative world. Artists are invited to interrogate the socio-political structures that impact care, challenging the dominant narratives and envisioning alternative ways of caring for themselves, their communities, their contemporary context, and the planet.This curatorial journey seeks to foster collaboration, cross-cultural dialogue, and the exchange of knowledge and experiences. It aims to bring together artists from diverse backgrounds, traditions, and disciplines, offering a platform for interdisciplinary exploration and co-creation. Through these collective endeavours, they aspire to amplify marginalized voices, celebrate diversity, and challenge the status quo, envisioning a world where care is at the forefront of their collective consciousness.""Take Care,"" as always with Radar Sofia, is an initiative that invites audiences to participate actively in this transformative journey. Through immersive performances, interactive installations, and thought-provoking discussions, spectators usually become integral participants, engaged in critical conversations and self-reflection. By creating spaces that encourage empathy, understanding, and solidarity, they aim to inspire individuals to take care of themselves, their communities, and the world at large.Together, through contemporary performative practices, theatre, and dramaturgy, they believe they can harness the power of storytelling, aesthetic experiences, and internal healing in order to resist the destructive forces, wherever they may come from.","","","<div class=""field field--name-field-body field--type-entity-reference-revisions field--label-hidden field__items""><div class=field__item> <div class=""paragraph paragraph--type--text paragraph--view-mode--full""><div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-paragraph-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item""><p>Radar Sofia is excited to announce the <a href=https://radarsofia.org/news/open-call-take-care target=_blank>Take Care Residency Programme 2023-2024</a> in Sofia, Bulgaria, dedicated to theatre makers, dramaturgs/playwrights, and performers who are passionate about exploring innovative approaches to their field.

Take Care is an urgent call to recognize the interconnectedness of their lives and to embrace the responsibility they have towards one another and their context/environment. Its theme resonates deeply within the realm of contemporary performative practices, theatre, and dramaturgy, inviting them to explore the profound significance of what care is or could be in their world now.</p><p>The arts can serve as a powerful medium for reflection, empathy, and transformation. Through the lens of contemporary performative practices, theatre, and dramaturgy, they can delve into the complexities of their human existence and unveil narratives that foster care, empathy, and social consciousness. The notion of ""Take Care"" urges them to question, provoke, and reimagine how they relate to themselves, each other, and the world they live in.</p><p>Within this context, their long-term curatorial approach seeks to create a space that nurtures both artists and audiences, offering a sanctuary for exploration, contemplation, and healing. It invites artists, theatre makers, and dramaturgs to delve into the multidimensional concept of care, embracing its diverse manifestations and highlighting the urgency to integrate care into their creative processes, narratives, and interactions.</p><p>""Take Care"" encourages artists to examine the intricate relationships between care, power dynamics, vulnerability, and resilience. It prompts them to explore how care can be both an act of resistance and a transformative force within the performative world. Artists are invited to interrogate the socio-political structures that impact care, challenging the dominant narratives and envisioning alternative ways of caring for themselves, their communities, their contemporary context, and the planet.</p><p>This curatorial journey seeks to foster collaboration, cross-cultural dialogue, and the exchange of knowledge and experiences. It aims to bring together artists from diverse backgrounds, traditions, and disciplines, offering a platform for interdisciplinary exploration and co-creation. Through these collective endeavours, they aspire to amplify marginalized voices, celebrate diversity, and challenge the status quo, envisioning a world where care is at the forefront of their collective consciousness.</p><p>""Take Care,"" as always with Radar Sofia, is an initiative that invites audiences to participate actively in this transformative journey. Through immersive performances, interactive installations, and thought-provoking discussions, spectators usually become integral participants, engaged in critical conversations and self-reflection. By creating spaces that encourage empathy, understanding, and solidarity, they aim to inspire individuals to take care of themselves, their communities, and the world at large.</p><p>Together, through contemporary performative practices, theatre, and dramaturgy, they believe they can harness the power of storytelling, aesthetic experiences, and internal healing in order to resist the destructive forces, wherever they may come from.</p></div></div></div></div>"

Selected artists will spend around four weeks as artists-in-residence in Guandu Nature Park and use natural or environmentally friendly materials to create artworks on-site that can convey environmental messages and raise awareness.As the main outlet of the Taipei Basin’s water system, the Guandu Plain is a wetland that contains many biological activities and serves as a flood detention area to protect the safety of the Taipei metropolitan area. From early agricultural activities to urban development, industrial pollution, garbage crises, global warming and climate change, rising sea levels, and the decline of biodiversity, the Guandu Plain is almost a microcosm of the entire environmental issue. However, through the establishment of a conservation area, it has been transformed into a gift. Therefore, life is sustained and evolved through the gift of nature.This year’s curatorial theme for the Guandu International Nature Art Festival, ‘Nature, a Gift - Connection, Giving, and Exchange’, is conceived as a gift to the Guandu Plain.

The Cavendish Laboratory has an extraordinary history of discovery and innovation in Physics since its opening in 1874. Research in the Cavendish has been instrumental in our understanding of the physical world, from creating theories of electromagnetism and discovering the electron to splitting the nucleus and developing X-ray crystallography to see inside the atom.
Today, fundamental questions addressed by research in the laboratory range from understanding space and the origin of the universe to exploring time, matter and energy in all its forms and at every scale, from the very large to the inconceivably small.
In 2024, the Cavendish Laboratory will be moving to its new state-of-the-art and purpose-built home, the Ray Dolby Centre.
They are looking for the third Cavendish Arts Science at Girton College Fellow. This unique collaborative opportunity is open to artists internationally and is not confined to any single aesthetic, theme, or medium. The Fellowship is financially supported. Artists with no previous experience of working with scientists or in a scientific environment are particularly encouraged to apply.
The Fellowship will last one year from October 2023 and will include a residency period at Girton College in Cambridge, typically of at least six months up to one year, with the potential for the period of residency to be split across two visits.
The artist will receive a stipend, accommodation and subsistence during the period of residency. A budget will be provided for the production of new work, and for travel.
The successful applicant will normally be elected Visiting Fellow Commoner in the Arts at Girton College and will
Develop thought-provoking ideas through engagement with physicists and those in other fields
Experiment with new approaches to their practice that are transformative and push boundaries
Produce new work to be exhibited during the Fellowship and beyond
Have opportunities to exhibit work in other contexts including the opening of the Cavendish Laboratory (Ray Dolby Centre) in 2024, and potentially those created through national and international partnerships.

This kind of innovation is vital to address the social, ecological, and economic challenges facing Europe in the coming years. The initiative emphasizes the equal relevance of scientists, tech experts, and artists in the innovation process, as they influence and enrich each other's perspectives and practices.
As part of the S+T+ARTS initiative, the S+T+ARTS Residency Programmes facilitate collaborations at the intersections of science, technology, and the arts, leading to pioneering results in creativity and innovation.
The Art-driven innovation for digital and green transition in European Regions (GRIN) is a preparatory action under the S+T+ARTS initiative, aiming to organize 12 artistic residencies in Austria, Italy, Portugal, and Finland, focused on effective solutions and cases for the digital and green transition.
Art-driven innovation for digital and green transition in European Regions (GRIN) is a STARTS regional centres preparatory action that aims to develop effective solutions for the digital and ecological transition in Europe, with a focus on Upper Austria, Emilia-Romagna, Aveiro, Porto District, and North Ostrobothnia.
GRIN is now looking for artists to explore the development of solutions that can address the digital and ecological transition in Europe. The GRIN residencies are focused on addressing four main themes, which include Green and Blue Infrastructure, Circular Solutions, Climate Neutrality, and Well-Being and Sustainable Living.
The themes are further divided into specific topics for each region:
GRIN Residencies in Linz, Austria: Hatred on the Internet, The Climate Crisis, Well-Being of young people.
GRIN Residencies in Bologna, Italy: Supercomputing, Quantum and Digital Twin.
GRIN Residencies in Porto, Portugal – AR Contemporary Theatre.
GRIN Residencies in Aveiro, Portugal – Drone technologies for biodiversity.
GRIN Residencies in Oulu, Finland – Sound and Print.
Artists who are interested in applying for the GRIN residencies can select a specific topic and region for their project proposals, with residencies hosted by local GRIN partners.
The aim of the residencies is to produce an art-driven experiment of stimulating the uptake of digital technologies, either by EU citizens and companies, to address social, business and sustainability challenges. Outcomes of the residencies should represent a technical demonstrator of the technology proposed, coupled with the artistic demonstrator of the novel usage scenario proposed by the artist.
The final result would be an artwork in the form of an artistic demonstration e.g. performance, video, sculpture, immersive experience, digital artistic assets.
12 artists will be selected for six-month residencies. Funding per artist is 40,000 EUR.

These funded programs provide artists, writers, ecologists, humanities scholars, and others, time and space to work on their creative projects while living in a supportive community in a bucolic setting.
OSGF's Eliza Moore Fellow and Interdisciplinary Residents are selected based on their work’s alignment with OSGF’s mission. There is no fee to apply, and the application can be accessed here.
Founded in 2016, the mission of the Oak Spring Garden Foundation (OSGF) is to “perpetuate and share the gifts of Rachel (“Bunny”) Lambert Mellon, including her residence, garden, estate and the Oak Spring Garden Library, to serve the public interest. OSGF is dedicated to inspiring and facilitating scholarship and public dialogue on the history and future of plants, including the culture of gardens and landscapes and the importance of plants for human well-being.”
The Eliza Moore Fellowship is awarded annually to one outstanding early-career artist whose work shows remarkable promise to contribute to a deeper understanding of our natural world and humankind's place in it. The award includes a 10,000 USD individual grant, and a two to five-week residency at the Oak Spring estate in Upperville, Virginia. The Eliza Moore Fellow will be asked to complete their residency when there are Interdisciplinary Residents, or other residents on-site with whom they can engage.
The Interdisciplinary Residency is awarded annually to about 40 individuals who may be in early-career, mid-career, or established in their field. Interdisciplinary Residents join a cohort of four to eight other individuals for either two weeks or five weeks. A two-week Interdisciplinary Residency includes an 800 USD individual grant, and a five-week Interdisciplinary Residency includes a 2,000 USD individual grant. Each cohort will arrive and depart on the same day, and they will have organized events including introductory tours and a few weekly communal meals prepared by OSGF’s Chef Jason Neve.
Residents and fellows are housed in nicely appointed shared accommodations where they will have a private bedroom and bathroom, and share a living room and kitchen with one to three other residents. We seek Residents and Fellows who are courteous, and community-minded.
Residents and fellows will have ample time to work independently on their own projects, and there will be a number of optional opportunities to engage with OSGF’s resources. This will include optional volunteer hours at OSGF’s Formal Garden, designed by our founder Rachel “Bunny” Lambert Mellon, volunteer hours at our Biocultural Conservation Farm, and access to the walking trails across OSGF’s 700-acre landscape.
Residents and fellows will also be able to make appointments to visit the Oak Spring Garden Library during staff hours (8 am–4 pm, Monday–Friday). The Oak Spring Garden Library holds over 19,000 objects including rare books and manuscripts. This special resource includes many historical examples of botanical art and illustration.
There is one application process for the 2024 Eliza Moore Fellowship and the Interdisciplinary Residency. Individuals who are unsure if they meet the requirements for the Eliza Moore Fellowship are encouraged to apply and to ask to be considered for the Interdisciplinary Residency if they are not selected.
There is no fee to apply and applications are due May 31, 2023, at 11:59 pm EST. Applications will be reviewed by OSGF staff and program alumni. External selection committees of relevant professionals will select the 2024 Eliza Moore Fellow, and 2024 Interdisciplinary Residents.

It is an opportunity for international artists to work on their projects in a focused and safe environment while also experiencing the diverse contemporary music theatre scene in Vienna and having the chance to establish new connections and relationships within the local performing arts network. MUSIKTHEATERTAGE WIEN will be hosting four residencies in 2023 and 2024, as part of the EU-funded residency project ""What's Next?"".
Accommodation, workspace, fees, and networking opportunities are offered to selected artists. Travel to and from Vienna and living quarters are provided free of charge, and each artist receives a daily allowance of 30 Euros. Residing artists are provided with a 200 square-metre working and rehearsal space in Vienna, including sound equipment. Technical requirements are to be clarified in advance. During the residency, the artists will have opportunities to connect with Austrian music theatre creators and visit current cultural events and productions such as Wiener Festwochen. The residency will be concluded with a friendly gathering of the local music theatre network and an informal presentation by the visiting artists.
To apply, collectives and artist groups within the field of contemporary music theatre who are currently working on a project can send a CV or description of the artist collective/group, short biographies for each artist, a portfolio of selected works as a PDF file or a link to the portfolio website included in the e-mail, and a statement text explaining their intention and motivation of their residency in Vienna (max. one A4 page).
The application deadline is May 14, 2023, at 6 pm CET. The festival team will assess the applications, and selected residents will be informed by May 17th. For further information or questions concerning the residency, contact [email protected].
""What's Next?"" is a project that aims to create a common safe and brave space for artists, cultural managers, activists, and citizens in 5 European countries to reflect on challenges Europe has faced in the recent decade. Cultural (micro) organizations from Ukraine, Poland, Romania, Germany, and Austria will provide interconnected spaces for reflection for artists and cultural workers to come together and collaborate. The project aims to create a physical and mental space where small-scale organizations can work together in a collective co-authorship process, slow down their activity, and allow time for reflection and exploring the emotions and memories of participants in residencies. The project also aims to develop participatory practices, create a context for peer-to-peer learning and sharing practices, and empower and connect artists to society. The project seeks to use contemporary art as a tool for cultural development and to increase the well-being of society and its citizens.","","","<div class=""field field--name-field-body field--type-entity-reference-revisions field--label-hidden field__items""><div class=field__item> <div class=""paragraph paragraph--type--text paragraph--view-mode--full""><div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-paragraph-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item""><p>In June 2023, music theatre collectives and artists are invited to participate in a one-week residency in Vienna, Austria (12-19 June 2023).

Selection and Eligibility:
This residency is open to contemporary visual artists in the early stages of their careers, working across all disciplines, based in South Africa or Zimbabwe. Applicants that currently reside outside of these countries are not eligible for this opportunity, and aspiring artists producing high-quality work who have not had the opportunity to work in London before will be prioritised. While they welcome applications from all disciplines, it is also important to note Gasworks’ restricted facilities. Applicants should have at least a moderate level of spoken English and should feel comfortable engaging in artistic discussions in English. It is important that all applicants research Gasworks thoroughly before submitting their application so as to be fully aware of the context in which they would, if successful, be entering.
The selected artist should be able to engage discursively and speculatively with Gasworks' environment and London's wider artistic and cultural context. With this in mind, applicants should submit a project proposal within their application, outlining their specific research interests and intentions for the residency. Those who fail to submit a considered proposal that is specific to this residency and the London context will be disqualified.
They encourage applications from all backgrounds. Gasworks’ building is fully accessible, and arrangements could be made to provide fully accessible accommodation if necessary. Due to limited resources and facilities, they are unable to offer residencies to artistic duos or collectives. The funds available for each residency and room in our shared accommodation are for one person only. Similarly, they are unable to accommodate partners or children in the accommodation due to limited space, although artists requiring such accompaniment may still apply if they are able to arrange their own accommodation. They welcome enquiries and are open to discussing ways in which our residency programme can be adapted to cater to all artists’ needs. For any questions about access requirements and facilities, please contact [email protected].
Selection Process:
The artist will be selected based on their application. Gasworks will establish a selection panel to ensure a wide perspective on and in-depth knowledge of the contemporary art scene in the UK and Africa. It will include representatives from Gasworks as well as external advisors.
Please note that only the successful artist will be notified by 5 June 2023. Due to the expected high number of applications, we are unable to respond individually or provide feedback to unsuccessful applicants.
Application Procedure:
They accept digital applications only. Please use the online application form on the opportunity page on Gasworks’ website. Your application should include the following in ONE PDF file only:
A cover sheet with your legal name, home or contact address, e-mail, and telephone numbers, plus confirmation that you will be available from 2 October – 18 December 2023, if selected. If applicable, please include any relevant social media handles and a link to your website.
Please note: this information is used in official documents so artists who work under alternative names should provide both their preferred name and their legal name as written on official documents, please ensure all the required information is included in the contact sheet.
An artist's statement describing your practice and areas of interest (max. 250 words)

place. The aim of the programme is to provide space for teamwork in the fields of crafts, architecture,
design and arts. Preference will be given to projects with local and/or ecological content. However, this
is not a prerequisite for application. Scholarships will be awarded to two groups for the year 2024.
The HS is located outside the village of Sykaminea, secluded in a 4000 sqm olive grove in the north of the
island of Lesvos. It consists of two wooden houses and a pergola. It was founded in 2016 as a place for
retreat. Between 2020-22 it has been restructured and became a gathering point for creativity.
Application requirements:
Support will be given to groups already working on a project or about to start one and need a place to work in concentration. The group should have worked together in the past and completed projects.
Groups of up to a maximum of 8 people can be accommodated.
Attendance is compulsory.
Duration of the residency

The hybrid residency will combine an on-site temporary presence along with previous and subsequent work to be carried out remotely. The two projects will be selected through a joint open call for submissions and will be carried out between September and December 2023.
Transversal Aesthetics is a programme for research and experimentation on the intersection between art, mediation and social space. A place of confluence between artistic practices as a vehicle for critical research; mediation activities as a vehicle for the production of content, interaction and learning transfer; and the urban context as a vehicle for connecting specific themes of work to a specific active social space relevant to these themes. A project which takes shape in medium-sized urban spaces, as generators of social, cultural and environmental spaces at the boundaries between rural and urban. The project is founded upon the cross-disciplinary dimension of art, in order to combine experiences and activities which impact upon unique elements on the basis of common themes and strategies shared among various participating agents.
There have been four previous editions of the Transversal Aesthetics programme by Idensitat and Centro Huarte, each of them focusing on a specific theme: ""Peripheral Ecosystems"", ""Ecosystems of Leisure"", ""Ecosystems of Fiction"", and ""Immunity ~ Community"". In this new edition, they will open up a process which makes a connection between the local context of the Arga River (Huarte) and that of the river Besòs (Barcelona), examining the common theme of ""Air"". Taking this as our starting point, they are issuing a joint open call for submissions in order to select two artistic projects which specifically address the complexity of dealing with air in contemporary thought.
The project Transversal Aesthetics / IN THE AIR, proposes to work from the tensions, paradoxes or connections generated by the concept AIRE/AIR, while also connecting them to a river, or its urban configuration, modelled along the course of the River Arga as it passes through the towns of Huarte, Villava and Burlada, or the mouth of the River Besòs as it touches upon neighbourhoods and towns in the metropolitan area of Barcelona. In each of these contexts, a specific project will be activated in an attempt to provide a creative option to the tension that this concept generates, in order to contribute to configuring a new view or perspective.
The town of Huarte, where Centro Huarte is located, stands next to the towns of Burlada and Villava on the outskirts of Pamplona. The three localities follow the course of the river Arga, which has generated historical and cultural links between the three towns. In recent years, the boundaries between natural, rural and urban areas in these towns have been modified, due to urban spread and population growth, the conversion of allotment gardens into leisure spaces, and the flow and periodic overspills of the river. This geographical enclave, framed by the flow of the river in connection with its natural and urban ecosystems, defines the specific working context.
In Barcelona, the working context for this project is the area made up of neighbourhoods in the metropolitan area near the mouth of the Besòs River (Trinitat Vella, Bon Pastor, Baró de Viver, La Sagrera, Sant Andreu). These neighbourhoods are located on the edge of the city in an area characterised by multiple connections to the north of the metropolitan zone. A densely populated area which has deepened its relationship with the river since its recovery as a natural space, becoming one of the main green areas of both the neighbourhoods and the metropole (Barcelona, Santa Coloma de Gramenet, Sant Adrià de Besòs and Montcada i Reixac). In this case, the mouth of the Besós, as it touches upon the various urban enclaves, defines the working context in Barcelona.
The work carried out as part of Transversal Aesthetics will follow three common strands: organising a temporary artistic residence, with the participation of an artist or a collective as creator and researcher within the context; setting up a local node involving various regional agents and associations; and organising a transfer of knowledge and learning related to other fields and subjects, in a suite of measures which we will denominate as Mediation Activities. These three strands may cross over, they may work in unison, or they may coexist in parallel so that at least two of them will work together on the same project.
The local nodes may comprise a number of agents, organisations or individuals with an interest in participating in the project, or who are associated with the social, artistic or research aspects of the theme. These nodes will be formed prior to the development of the artistic project and/or mediation activities, and may vary in character, or may grow larger as time goes on. The artist or collective must propose a project involving the node and must add their own agents to the network, who may become more or less involved, depending upon their role within the project’s framework. The project will be carried out in a triangular fashion, proposing activities or interventions in public space, open presentations and production of results.
Selected projects must investigate and explore aspects relevant to the context in order to activate working processes which address the reference points of the thematic field; from imagining other possible ecosystems to analysing existing ecosystems in order to address certain realities, or to constructing fictions that generate other possible realities. The territorial node, and activities of mediation, will involve local collectives and individuals interested in working within the proposed thematic field. The selected project will develop its work from this predefined context and theme.
The call is aimed at artists interested in developing an artistic project within the social contexts in which the proposal is set, and on the specific theme proposed. Proficiency in Spanish and/or Basque will be valued positively. In the event that English should be the main language used in the project, the translation should be considered as part of the production, in those activities that may require translation.
The selected proposal will be granted 2.300 euros in fees and expenses, and up to 750 euros for help with travel and accommodation. A maximum of 1.400 euros will be available for production. In the event that accommodation is not necessary, part of the travel costs may be used for production, or conversely, where greater face-to-face involvement in the context is required and production is less or can be covered by other funding, both fees may be used interchangeably.
From this call for submissions, two proposals will be selected for the two temporary residencies, one in Huarte and the other in Barcelona. The aim of each residency is to define a research and creation project based on the proposed theme. The results may be presented publicly in each of the working contexts, according to the nature of each project.
The selection process will be carried out in two phases. The first phase will consist of the submission of proposals, from which a minimum of four will advance to the second phase of selection. The second phase will consist of an interview with pre-selected artist/s in order to find out more about the motivation for applying, the proposal itself, and the proposal’s affinities with the thematic field and the framework offered by the organisers. From this second phase, two projects will be selected, and the successful applicants will be invited to take part in the residencies in Huarte and Barcelona. The panel for the selection process will include a member of each organisation (Idensitat and Centro Huarte), and the Institute for Postnatural Studies.

The organisers are looking for five artists in residence who will work individually and together to interrogate this topic in an artistic way.
We are seeing an increasing popularity and impact of AI applications ranging from large language models (LLMs), and image generation systems to social media recommendation algorithms. These technologies are shaping our society and, in turn, are being shaped by our changing society.
On the user side, popular artificial intelligence applications sell time by enabling users to perform certain cognitive tasks at higher speeds. While some may enjoy an increased sense of productivity, however, others see their time shrink as they manually sort, classify, and label millions of images for $2/hour.
Similarly, predictive algorithms exacerbate loops of being surveilled, of assumed repeat offenders, and of specific at-risk individuals. AI furthers a colonial capitalist logic along the lines of North/South, race, class, gender, and other systems of oppression.
AI itself acts as a “grand narrative” that shapes our understanding of the world and its temporality such as its future(s). Many forms of AI build on transhumanist and accelerationist narratives from science fiction and speculative arts that suggest possible futures and timelines. These tech-centric and often dystopian stories are taken up and acted upon by the tech industry actors, and thus in turn shape our present/realities and our understanding of time as a grand narrative.
How can we “dream beyond what is” in order to inspire new directions for the future and experience generative presents?
They would like to invite applicants to artistically engage with the above topics and submit a short project idea that can be worked on within two months and will result in an artistic output. In terms of content, they are looking for submissions that, for instance, make current mechanisms and effects of AI and temporality clear and understandable for a broad audience. Similarly, they are looking for proposals/visions for alternatives, more just presents that question current hegemonic orders. They explicitly invite emerging artists to apply for this program.
The residency will be compensated with 4000€ and will take place online and offline: 23.-30.06.2023 near Hamburg, Germany (in person) and July and September (digital). The projects will be presented by the artists in residence in Hamburg in the frame of a symposium.
Within their residency, participants will receive creative sparring with the artists Idil Galip, Moisés Horta, Neema Githere, Petja Ivanova, and Vanessa A. Opoku. The residency is conceptualized by Dreaming Beyond AI and is realized in cooperation with ifa, Deichtorhallen Hamburg and Kampnagel within the framework of thehost.is residency program.
Please apply here until April 23, 2023.
The call is open to individuals, persons from self-organized groups, and persons from collectives, who deal with societal issues in an activist, artistic, cultural-media, political-image, scientific, bodily/somatic or another way. They explicitly encourage applications from Black, Indigenous, Persons of Color / Women / LGBTQIA+ / dis_abled and emerging artists.
The residency will consist of an in-person part and a digital part. 23.-On the 30th of June, you will all meet in person in a cottage outside of Hamburg, Germany, and spend a week getting to know each other, brainstorming, crafting, discussing, and relaxing. The residents will start a digital residency (July as well as September 2023), culminating in a presentation of their work at Kampnagel/Deichtorhallen (format and date to be decided). During the digital residency, there will be digital touchpoints with the other fellows and the sparring partners (see below). The outcomes of the residency will finally be integrated as new contributions into the Dreaming Beyond AI platform.
The artists in residence will thus participate in two in-person meet-up formats as well as the digital residency. In addition, they need to provide materials on their work process for publication, as well as be available for public relations/press, if necessary.","","","<div class=""field field--name-field-body field--type-entity-reference-revisions field--label-hidden field__items""><div class=field__item> <div class=""paragraph paragraph--type--text paragraph--view-mode--full""><div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-paragraph-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item""><p>This year's <a href=http://thehost.is/ rel=noopener target=_blank>thehost.is</a> artistic residency is hosted by Dreaming Beyond AI and aims to explore the relationship between time and AI.

The 3 actors have chosen 4 emblematic textile materials of European heritage: linen, wool, leather and cork. The plant or animal nature of the chosen materials requires multiple skills and knowledge, as does their transformation into fibres and textile materials, which requires a great deal of technological knowledge. The project proposes 1 residency and 1 workshop per material. The aim of the residencies is to discover the textile chain of linen, leather, cork and wool and the workshops aim to improve one or two ecological skills of each of these materials. The residencies will take place in 2023 (between June and October) and the workshops in 2024 (between June and October).
Each fibre has its own dedicated residency and workshop. Each residency and workshop takes place with a team of 7 people. The results of this project are intended to be shown in a documentary and in the different events of the consortium: Contextile 2024 (Guimarães, Portugal), FITE – Biennale Textile 2024 (Clermont-Ferrand, France) and exhibitions in the art galleries of the Vilnius Academy of Arts (Lithuania). Through this funding, Creative Europe aims to improve access to European cultural and creative works and promote innovation and creativity.

In this call, choreographers from Egypt and partnered countries are invited to apply with their new concepts/creations projects, for a two months residency program in Cairo, Egypt, where they will work with Egyptian dancers/artists, as well as a modest production grant, to realize these productions.
For all foreign artists not residing in Cairo, all costs are covered including travel expenses, accommodation, rehearsal space and pocket money during the whole period.
They are looking for young and mid-career contemporary dancers and choreographers residing in Egypt, The United Kingdom, France, Switzerland, Germany, America and the Arabic region.
Preferably with a previous experience in artistic projects/spaces management and
teaching.

LAPA makes its connection with communities and asks what kind of potential could we encourage when we are housed together. Enacting the term LAPA, the residency becomes a space of communing to explore themes of home, family and place.
In 2023, the open call extends within Africa to expand on the continental network and establish necessary travel and connection.
The residency ideates on borderless states of being as a way to consider new pan-africanism and African states. This is beyond language but underpinned by modes of speaking through the visual, sonic, digital and more.
Taken from a text by Amilcar Cabral who prefaced ideas of unity and struggle within the African agenda, the phrase ‘Our people are our mountains’ illustrates the landscape and its metaphors as a condition of life: what is tied and coded between people into land and how it writes many other conditions of living.
Artists apply to one of three separate residency sessions:
Session 1 - Enunciation: Voicing in many forms: 1 September – 25 November 2023.
Session 2 – Imbibe earthen processes: 5 February – 27 April 2024.
Session 3 – Contextual landings: 2 September – 23 November 2024.
LAPA is developed for artists across all disciplines, based in Africa, who have been professionally active for at least 6 years. Priority will be given to pairings working on the continent or between the continent and the diaspora, understanding that these links exist in dynamic and political ways. The duo/pair/collective will seek to expand their working relationship to continue developing their artistic language and research. The residency can accommodate up to two representatives from an artist collective.
The organisers cover travel to and from LAPA (return flight and ground travel from OR Tambo Intl. Airport to Brixton, Johannesburg) and monthly living/subsistence costs. There is also a fee of 6000 ZAR/month (each) to cover basic living expenses and materials and resources. A separate budget allocation is made for the artist’s production budget and a public moment.

They invite emerging and established researchers worldwide to apply, including students, faculty, and independent scholars.
The Writer in Residence program offers a first look at newly processed primary sources and provides the opportunity to conduct research on exceptional artists and movements from postwar and contemporary Latin American art.
This summer, selected Writers in Residence will work remotely to explore materials from one of three fully digitized collections from the ISLAA Library and Archives: the Manuel Herreros de Lemos and Mateo Manaure Arilla Collection, a collection of selected artist’s books by Anna Bella Geiger, and the “El Dibujazo” Collection. Residents will produce an essay based on their selected digital collection, in alignment with their own research interests and expertise. Each selected participant will be awarded a $2,000 grant in recognition of these research and writing endeavors.
The application materials required include a research proposal, a CV, and a writing sample. Find out more about residency conditions and submission requirements here.
If you have questions about the ISLAA Writer in Residence program, please email Blanca Serrano Ortiz de Solórzano, ISLAA project director: [email protected].
The three digital collections selected for the Summer 2023 call for proposals are:
The Manuel Herreros de Lemos and Mateo Manaure Arilla Collection
This archival collection includes a restored digital edition of the film TRANS, a 1982 documentary film depicting transgender women in Caracas, shot by Manuel Herreros de Lemos and Mateo Manaure Arilla. Shown publicly only once, at the Cinemateca Nacional de Venezuela in 1983, this rare film pays homage to the testimonies and experiences of transgender women and bears witness to their experiences of transphobia and discrimination. The collection also includes photographic prints taken by Herreros de Lemos during the documentary’s preproduction phase and ephemera related to the film.
All written documents and ephemera in this collection are in Spanish.
Artist’s books by Anna Bella Geiger
This collection comprises seventeen artist’s books by Brazilian conceptual artist Anna Bella Geiger. Executed between 1974 and 1977, the spiral-bound notebooks, which contain pencil and ink sketches as well as collages, examine the conditions that drove artistic production in Brazil at the time of their production, considering questions of cultural hegemonies and interdependencies, marginality and domination within space and language, and the role of perspective and perception therein. Featured titles include A Alimentação (1975), Admissão (1975), História do Brasil (1975–76), and Sobre a arte (1976).
All written documents and ephemera in this collection are in Portuguese.
“El Dibujazo” Collection
In the 1960s, young artists in Uruguay turned to the medium of drawing and experimented with neorealism and neo-Expressionism. Often known as “El Dibujazo,” this generation explored the changing sociopolitical cityscape of Montevideo and reflected on topics such as mass media and class struggles. This collection attests to the vibrancy of Montevideo’s gallery scene at that time and includes more than one hundred works on paper in graphite, ink, mixed media, watercolor, and posters by artists such as Eduardo Fornasari, Alberto Schunk, and Marta Restuccia.
All written documents and ephemera in this collection are in Spanish.

In form and concept, we are attuned to critique, poetic proliferation, mutation, decay, adaptation, and the subversion of algorithms. How, for example, can various sonic ways of knowing infiltrate and mutate platform capitalist predictions and assumptions? With a strong focus on experimentation, they encourage artists whose practice uses sound, in its many platforms, as artistic and critical material to partake in this online residency.
Algorithmic experimentation spans conceptual or technical thinking about digital relations, internet architectures, and subcultures, online sharing or dissemination practices, and technological developments. An experimental approach reconsiders and questions how behavioural data categorization, digital visibility, information pattern recognition, and data collection are implemented for algorithms. With this in mind, what are ways to expand the algorithm, redefine machine relations, and critique data identification with sound?
The open call takes inspiration from poet, literary critic, and philosopher Édouard Glissant, who authored Poetics of Relation, and how this seminal work and his other writings are periodically tweeted via the @Glissantbot1 in English and French – creating an algorithmic poetics with a coded prompt. In the words of Glissant, »Poetics of relation is about allowing for the surprise of the unexpected connection, the unexpected similarity, the unexpected meeting. It is about recognizing that relationships and connections between things are never fixed but always in a state of flux and transformation.« Poetics of relation describes the process of creating meaningful relationships between seemingly disparate elements, emphasizing the interconnectedness of all things. They encourage proposals using sound, listening, and/or recording practices to explore how these different elements interact and how to create significant or consequential relationships between them.
This residency is remote and offers a framework to think about sound projects from varied perspectives and positions rooted in critique, clashes, the imagined, and/or subversion.
In favour of supporting the constantly changing nature of digital online work, and promoting experimental approaches, we do not prescribe the format in which applicants choose to present their work. Yet, the Digital Solitude program provides web space for each web resident and hosts and distributes their web-based projects within a given frame. In addition, the program works with a web designer/UX designer and programmer who can assist in implementing the project. In addition to presenting and sharing projects online, the program is currently working on offline formats related to the call. This could be a listening session, a panel, an exhibition, or a curated program in fall 2023, to be defined more precisely with the web residents’ working group. They encourage the applicants to consider the accessibility of the users, who may range in age, race, gender, economic class, and ability.
Four project proposals will be selected and rewarded with an online residency and a grant of 1,200 euros.
Please send your application until April 30, 2023 (midnight IDLW / UTC−12:00) to [email protected] by submitting your project proposal in the form of:
– a headline
– a header image (high resolution, landscape format)
– a short concept text in English (1,000–1,500 characters with spaces)
– a short text describing in which format the project should be presented (400 characters with spaces
– a short bio in English (400 characters with spaces)
– a PDF portfolio
– additional links to previous works
Artists of all disciplines as well as former Solitude fellows may apply. There is no age limit.

Under the sign of dialogue, exchange and cooperation, OSCILLATIONS aims to support artist residencies; sonic installations and exhibitions; listening and reading sessions; broadcast and podcast content; and workshops and archive experiments in Berlin, Cape Town and cyberspace. With OSCILLATIONS, the interplay of sound and knowledge production very much informs the act of critical listening. The project prompts participating artists and audiences both in South Africa and Germany to reassess their modes of aesthetic and informative auditory perception. It encourages participants to take pleasure in listening to unfamiliar sound materials, to gather knowledge through sonic translation, and to question inherited assumptions about cultural and economic hegemony which remain key to a critical sonic practice.
To counteract stereotypical and received views on and about Africa – as a physical geography open to all manner of exploitative extraction – OSCILLATIONS will bring attention to the ways in which sound and the sonic might build an ethics and aesthetics of care and of freedom. Exemplary of shifts in discourse, and trans-hemispheric relations, OSCILLATIONS attends to how politics, power and reimagined concepts of agency interlock with the materialities of sound – as object, with sonic artistic practice – as knowing and with sounds’ aesthetic histories – as a way to develop shared conceptual vocabularies and intellectual capacities.
OSCILLATIONS is a project by Akademie der Künste (Berlin), Centre for Humanities Research at the University of the Western Cape (Cape Town) and Deutschlandfunk Kultur / Klangkunst (Berlin).
OSCILLATIONS is funded by the TURN2 Fund of the Kulturstiftung des Bundes (German Federal Cultural Foundation). Funded by the Beauftragte der Bundesregierung für Kultur und Medien (Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media).
Supported by the DAAD Arts & Media Program, Kulturstiftung Schloss Wiepersdorf, and the National Institute for the Humanities and Social Sciences (NIHSS).
This Open Call for Residencies is aimed at sound artists, scholars and cultural practitioners based in southern Africa. Directed at mid-career sound artists, the Berlin open call, partly supported by the DAAD Arts & Media Program, includes three residencies, each for a period of two months. In Cape Town, the call includes two two-month residencies for mid-career practitioners and two one-month residencies for entrants new to the field of sonic inquiry and practice. Residencies can be taken up in the June 2023 – March 2024 period.","","","<div class=""field field--name-field-body field--type-entity-reference-revisions field--label-hidden field__items""><div class=field__item> <div class=""paragraph paragraph--type--text paragraph--view-mode--full""><div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-paragraph-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item""><p>Attuned to trans-hemispheric engagements in sound and knowledge production, the Akademie der Künste, the Centre for Humanities Research, University of the Western Cape, and Deutschlandfunk Kultur are pleased to announce the start of a joint project,<a href=""https://www.adk.de/de/news/?we_objectID=65135"" rel=noopener target=_blank> OSCILLATIONS: Sonic Inquiries and Practices</a>, and an open call for artist residency applications from sound artists, scholars and cultural practitioners based in southern Africa.</p><p>Under the sign of dialogue, exchange and cooperation, OSCILLATIONS aims to support artist residencies; sonic installations and exhibitions; listening and reading sessions; broadcast and podcast content; and workshops and archive experiments in Berlin, Cape Town and cyberspace.

It intends to introduce participants to current and relevant practices as well as to the mechanisms of curating in relation to exhibitions, institutions, audiences, aesthetics and cultural political discourse.
Throughout the two-week program, participants intensively expand their professional knowledge and practice by conducting in-depth investigations of contemporary exhibitions, getting introduced to case studies of leading curators and their engagements, taking part in curatorial workshops, visiting artist’s studios, and exchanging, discussing with each other during the meetings. By sharing the experiential and theoretical best practices of leading contemporary art museums, and galleries, the program offers a unique chance for the participants to develop project ideas, conduct research of their particular interests, enrich connections and networks internationally as well as elaborate discussions with contemporary art professionals active in Budapest and Veszprém.
Participation fee: 1200 EUROS

La Becque offers state-of-the-art live and work infrastructure for creative residents. Its vast garden hosts a total of 8 fully-equipped live-and-work apartment, an additional 4 studios including a sound studio, a ceramic and wood workshop, a library and an event/conference space, as well as several rooms intended to facilitate shorter-term stays and projects alongside longer residency stays.

La Becque dedicates particular attention to projects exploring the ever more intertwined notions of nature, the environment, and of technology.

FIAR was founded to provide free live/work space for practicing and emerging queer contemporary artists while immersed in the decades-old LGBTQ community of Fire Island.
Fire Island Artist Residency (FIAR) is a non-profit organization founded in 2011 which brings lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, non-binary, intersex and queer identifying emerging visual artists to Fire Island— a place long-steeped in LGBTQ history— to create, commune, rest, reflect and contribute to the location's rich artistic history.
Each summer FIAR provides free live/work space to visual artists who work, socialize, and immerse themselves in the Fire Island community for four weeks, during which time they are visited by renowned artists and scholars, who interact with residents through intimate studio visits, dinners, and discussions, providing support and feedback. The greater Fire Island community, as well as visitors from New York City and Long Island, are invited to attend free public lectures by these esteemed guests. This has been made possible through a partnership with Arts Project Cherry Grove, who invites FIAR to hold our programming in the historic Cherry Grove Community House, a landmarked LGBTQ historic site.
In this way, FIAR hopes to bring both new creative perspectives and prestigious art professionals together in this extraordinary location to foster the creation—and preservation—of queer art-making in contemporary art, creative writing and scholarship.

The residency is a unique opportunity to delve into the artistic and creative process enjoying rural environment and a great opportunity to connect with Barcelona's art scene. This residency welcomes multidisciplinary artists and creative practitioners who are challenging the assumptions made about rural life and culture, providing a new vision of the countryside grounded in everyday experience of the rural-urban binary. By pointing out the question of how art and culture can be used as an element to create rural-urban synergies, resident artists are invited to explore and contribute to this pairing.

In its second cycle, the Contemporary Performing Arts Research Residency is an artistic research development programme by Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay, supported by the National Arts Council, Singapore.
The fully-funded residency aims to support creative research in contemporary performing arts by providing its residents with the time and space for artistic inquiry, experimentation, development, research activities and opportunities for interdisciplinary and transcultural dialogues. The residency welcomes various manners and methodologies of enquiry, embracing a pluralistic approach towards research that unfolds not only through the written word, but also includes forms of experimentation with the body, performed moments, and other non-traditional systems of knowledge.
There is no commitment for residents to create a production during or after the residency. Instead, residents will be asked to present at least one public programme of their choosing, developed in conversation with the Esplanade Team.
The residency is a duration of between one month to three months long and residents will receive a stipend, access to a shared-working space, and studios when required, as well as accommodation and international travel to or from Singapore, if from abroad.
There will be biennial open calls held for applications to the residency and each cycle will revolve around a thematic focus conceived to respond to current critical issues in our society. In 2024, the residency presents the thematic focus of Decentring Access.
Residents are chosen through a selection panel comprising leading international curators, programmers, academics, artists and managers. They have been appointed based on their thought-provoking practices, dynamic networks with practitioners from a wide variety of disciplines and their invaluable knowledge of the performing arts across Singapore, Asia and beyond. The Selection Panel will also serve as interlocutors in the programme’s development and be available as consultants for all residents.
A term frequently used in conversations revolving around healthcare, education, and universally designed and accessible spaces, the thematic focus Decentring Access aims to engage the term’s multiple definitions and usages in all contexts and facilitate nuance into access-related discussions. Engaging with the dynamics of inclusion and exclusion, the residency seeks to support research projects that employ performativity as a lens to examine pertinent issues today. These topics are not limited to equity, inclusivity in physical and digital worlds, movement, ownership, climate crisis, power relations, age, gender, race, disability, language and knowledge circulation.
These impulses also endeavour to investigate the intersectional confluences of thinking about access in social, cultural, economic, practical, regulatory, institutional and technological spheres, and understand access needs as coming from plural and decentralised ways of knowing and experiencing the world.
The residency welcomes proposals that complement and interpret the conceptual lines of the thematic focus alongside the applicant’s artistic practice and interest.

Onassis AiR, invites artists, curators, designers, dancers, chefs, gardeners, activists, writers, educators, legal advocates, performers, economists, architects, filmmakers and other practitioners from any medium of expression or discipline, from anywhere in the world, to apply for a tailor-made residency running between September 2023 and July 2024 in Athens, Greece.
Onassis AiR opened its doors in 2019 grounding its mission in supporting the artistic process by fostering cross-disciplinary thinking and exchange of an ever-growing community of artists and other practitioners that participated in its various programs. After completing a three-year programming cycle, Onassis AiR embarked on a new chapter that brings together each and every creative practitioner within the Onassis Foundation arts ecosystem, either through individual research residencies via the yearly Open Calls of Onassis AiR, through research and development fellowships commissioned by Onassis Culture or awarded via our International Networks in partnership with other institutions.
As their programs expand, so does their urge to stay relevant to the needs of their artistic community, as they arise, while being part of larger discussions that are happening worldwide regarding issues that concern societies today -democracy, human rights, and mental health. Their aim is to cultivate a common ground where our mixed perspectives that come from our different practices and the geographies we live in can coexist. For them, this ground begins in Athens—from our engagement in exploring the urban and street culture of the city they live in with its many communities, its present and past histories,—and radiates outward, to their peripheries, the rural areas, rituals, crafts, food culture, and vernacular knowledge produced outside of the metropolitan centres, while in dialogue with the wider Balkan and Mediterranean region where they are located.
The tailor-made residency is a programme of individual residencies, each lasting for a maximum of three months. Each residency stems from the participants’ needs. This program is for anyone in need of support who is yearning for space, focused time, and stimulating conversations that can help to kick off, further develop, or finalize a project and who is interested in engaging with the locale of Athens. All participants are invited to use the Οnassis AiR space and resources to develop their thinking and practices without the expectation of presenting a final work. Additionally, the programme offers professional development activities including mentoring sessions, presentations and peer-to-peer feedback sessions, organized site visits to local art spaces and other institutions, and opportunities to meet and connect with local artists and arts professionals. Founded on the principles of learning and doing with others, Onassis AiR fosters the conditions for dialogue and exchange between peers through collective activities addressed to the Onassis AiR Community. These can take the form of a workshop, an in-progress presentation, a lecture or screening, or any other format the Fellows wish to propose.
Apply here to join the AiR community.
The selection for the ONASSIS AiR OPEN CALL 2023/24 will be done in three phases. Phase I follows a peer-to-peer blind-selection method by the current and former participants of Onassis AiR. During Phase II the selected applications will be reviewed by the Onassis AiR team in collaboration with an external selection committee consisting of Sepake Angiama and VASKOS. In Phase III all shortlisted applicants will do an interview with the Onassis AiR team.
The working language of the program is English.
All accepted participants will receive a research fee, housing, travel to/from Athens, a research budget, and other resources.
The deadline for submission of all applications is Monday, March 20, 2023. All applications must be submitted no later than 12:00 pm Eastern European Time (UTC +2). All applicants will be informed by email about the result of their application, by June 12, 2023.
If you have general questions during the time that the Open Call online platform is open (between February 20 – March 20, 2023), about the application or the program, please email [email protected].

“Disruption: The Imprint of Man” aims to offer a unique vantage point on the Anthropocene. Building on the past residency theme “Anthropocene — The Imprint of Man” (2014-2017), “Disruption” broadens the focus beyond the environment to include topical social issues in the European Union: the decline of solidarity and respect as values, generational clashes, and the meaning of intra and international relations. Artists are invited to meditate on human behaviour and its consequences. “Disruption” is therefore understood not only in its physical sense but also as a social, cultural and behavioural phenomenon.
The ADP offers emerging European visual artists a three-month residency at Cité internationale des arts in Paris, enabling them to develop their practice and create a new (body of) work(s), boosted by the mentorship of a renowned artist. In 2023, the recipients will be mentored by acclaimed Franco-Italian artist Tatiana Trouvé.
Eligibility criteria:
Born after 1 January 1988 (in the case of an artist duo, both members must be aged 35 or under)
EU nationals (in the case of an artist duo, both members must be EU nationals)
Fluency in English
Budget and duration:
The residency in Paris will take place from 4 September until 27 November 2023. The EIB Institute will cover the artist’s travel costs to and from Paris (for the residency). The artist will receive an €80 (eighty euro) flat-rate daily allowance to cover their living costs during the residency and all or part of the production costs and will be provided with a live-in-studio space.
In addition to the above, the artist will be granted a contribution towards production of €500 (five hundred euro) at the beginning of the residency and a success fee of €1 000 (one thousand euro) at the end of the residency, provided that they have produced a work or body of works.
Upon completion of the residency, the EIB may consider acquiring an artwork produced on-site by the artist.
Application procedure:
All applications must be submitted through the online form available here.
Required documents:
A CV in English (maximum four pages) including education, work experience, solo and group shows, and media coverage.
A letter of motivation (in English) with ideas to be explored during the residency, in line with the proposed theme (maximum 700 words).
A portfolio (maximum eight pages in A4 PDF format) to showcase a representative selection of the applicant’s works.
Please note that proof of nationality and age will be requested if shortlisted.
Selection procedure:
A jury — consisting of Tatiana Trouvé (the mentor), members of the EIB Arts Committee, a representative of Cité Internationale des Arts and external art advisers — will select the candidates based on the artistic quality of their work, their motivation and their potential to make the most of the opportunity offered by the residency, as well as the relevance of their practice to the cultural context of the EIB Institute.
The selected candidate will be informed of the jury’s decision by email at the end of May 2023.
Application deadline: Midnight (GMT+1), Friday, 31 March 2023.
Any application failing to comply with the set requirements will be automatically disqualified.

This Prize is a call to act, transform, heal, revive, and hybridize. A call to feel the richness of plants, their balances and dynamics, from seed to calyx, from molecule to ecosystem. A call to try and, why not, to fail, because failure is the seed of growth.
The winner of the COAL Prize will be awarded 12,000 euros and benefits from a residence in the heart of the Domaine de Belval, property of the François Sommer Foundation, run by the scientific and educational teams of the Museum of Hunting and Nature and those of the Domaine de Belval. Located in the commune of BelvalBois-des-Dames, in the French Ardennes, the Domaine de Belval is a veritable observatory of rural life and wildlife, which welcomes artists selected each year for their contribution to the renewal of the vision of the relationship between humans and their natural environment.
Applicants will be judged on the following criteria: artistic value, relevance (understanding of the theme - Plant!), originality (the ability to introduce new approaches, themes, and points of view), pedagogy (ability to get a message across and raise awareness), social and participative approaches (engagement, testimony, efficiency, societal dynamics), eco-design and feasibility. The COAL Prize supports artistic projects in progress. Its award is not intended to cover all production costs of the project but should be considered as an aid to its development

The open call is intended for professional artists from all fields. Residencies for 2024 can be applied for in Kone Foundation’s online service for grant applications. Applications must be submitted no later than 31 March 2023 at 4 p.m. Only applications submitted via the online grant service during the application period will be considered.
Saari Residence, which started its operations in 2008 and is maintained by Kone Foundation, is an international residence for artists in Mynämäki, Southwest Finland. Located in a beautiful and peaceful rural setting, the Saari Residence offers professional artists and groups of artists from all fields of art the opportunity to break away from their everyday routines and focus on their artistic work. Saari Residence is not aimed, for example, at networking within the field of art or putting on exhibitions or performances, and no exhibition or performance is required at the end of the residency.
At the Saari Residence, you can immerse yourself in your artistic work, develop potential new directions, and engage in fruitful interaction with the other residents. The Saari Residence also gives artists a platform to meet each other and share their thoughts and ideas at the Saari Well, which is one part of the residence that makes it unique.
During individual residencies, there are seven artists, one invited artist and one researcher working at the Saari Residence at the same time. In addition, a community artist works at the residence throughout the year. For each residency period, they select Finnish and international artists representing different fields of art, both young artists and those who are further along in their careers. In the summer months, there are working groups of artists (minimum three people, maximum 18) working at the residence for periods of 2 to 4 weeks.
Every year, the Saari Residence provides work facilities for between 35 and 50 individual artists, researchers, or working groups. Since it opened, the residence has hosted approximately 700 artists and researchers from over 50 countries. Last year, 580 individual artists and working groups from 72 countries applied for residency. A total of 507 applications were submitted for individual residencies, of which 56 were working partners. There were 73 applications for group residencies. A residency for 2023 was granted to 6 percent of the applicants.
Saari Residence’s long-term residence activities and way of thinking are determined by sustainability, and the key words are slowness, insight and change. When selecting artists for the residence, whether they work with ecological topics is not one of our selection criteria; instead, their focus on ecology lies in the residence’s overall activities.
Sustainability thinking permeates the entire residence’s operations, from everyday activities to environmental biodiversity work. Art and its potential for change involves are key to generating insights and understanding.
Saari Residence’s residence activities and thinking are defined by responsibility, which includes not only the environment but also social and psychological sustainability. Each residency period offers opportunities for insights at both the practical level and the level of thought through various study groups, discussions and workshops.
Taking care of the artists and researchers working at the Saari Residence and their peace of mind is at the core of the residence’s activities. At Saari, they follow the principles of a safe space and also take into account the perspectives of diversity, inclusion and equality, as well as the accessibility of our activities and related development needs.
Applications for residencies are always submitted a year before the residency takes place. The application period starts on 1 March and ends on 31 March at 4 p.m.
The four two-month-long working periods for individual artists take place in the spring and autumn, and from June to mid-August, all the premises of the residence are reserved for groups of artists working there for a period of 2 to 4 weeks.
Applications for the artist residencies are submitted in Kone Foundation’s online service for grants. Please note that they do not accept applications by email or other means outside the online service. Please read the application instructions carefully before compiling yours.
They welcome applications for a residency at Saari from individual Finnish and international professional artists, authors, translators, curators and critics, as well as groups of artists (working groups and organisations with a business ID). Residencies are intended for artistic work in accordance with the work plan presented in the application. Priority is given to multidisciplinary, new, or non-mainstream themes and fields of art.
The common language of the international residence for artists is English.
Researchers or non-fiction writers cannot apply for residency through an open application.
An individual residency spanning two months includes your own apartment, a workroom and a monthly grant, the amount of which is determined according to the applicant’s experience (€2,500 / €3,000 / €3,600 per month).
Groups can apply for a weekly residency grant (€750 per week) for their group members for a work period of 2 to 4 weeks. Groups have more compact accommodation and share apartments, but as a rule, each group has its own workspace.
In addition, each artist selected for an individual residency has the opportunity to engage in discussions with their pre-appointed mentors. The mentors of the Saari Residence are key professionals in their own field of art in Finland, and each of them also has a personal relationship with the Saari Residence.

Initiated in 2019, the Laboratoire Modulaire intends to question the notion of ‘spatialisation’ by exploring the constantly evolving relationships between digital devices and the design of spaces: immersive environments (sound or visual), virtual reality, augmented reality, crossed reality… Its aim is to design new forms of sensitive interaction within physical, virtual, and hybrid spaces in order to create environments, ecosystems, and digital territories involving the body.
The call is aimed at artists conducting research related to the issues raised by Laboratoire Modulaire and working on digital practices and technologies. A public presentation of the project will be expected at the end of the residency.
The artist-researcher will participate in Laboratoire Modulaire’s activities: meetings with the team, artistic and research events, invitations to artists, theoreticians, researchers, etc. He/she/they will also have the opportunity to be part of the organisation of such activities.
The residency is dedicated to the implementation of a research project. However, because of the close links between research and pedagogy of an art school, pedagogical interventions may take place and will be the subject of a specific agreement.

Two artists and/or collectives will be welcomed in residence (one international and one from the Wallonia-Brussels Federation) in the beautiful studios (2 apartments that can each accommodate up to 2 people) located at the Centre Culturel des Abattoirs de Bomel from Monday, April 24 to Sunday, May 21, 2023. Each artist (collective) will receive a grant of 5.000 € to develop an Art / Science project on the theme of ecological futures, as well as curatorial and scientific support to develop their production project.
The residency gives artistic researchers from various fields the opportunity to work on the intersection of art, science and ecological questions. The aim is to develop useful arts-led interdisciplinary research tools and artworks to examine how cultural practitioners critically address and creatively negotiate ecological futures.
The call includes the research field of the climate crisis and global warming, loss of biodiversity, models of human and non-human co-existence and the interrelationships of different ecosystems, in relation to the following questions: How can we reduce our ecological footprint and decolonize nature? How do new models of human and non-human co-existences look like? What kind of promising changes does biotechnology offer? And how can we create a new consciousness and awareness regarding the imbalance of nature and culture?
This programme is the result of a collaboration between three partners: the CCN/Cultural Center Namur providing exhibition and residency spaces, the KIKK Festival; annual festival of digital and creative cultures explores the intersections between art, science, technology and society. As well as the creative hub TRAKK (thanks to the support of En Mieux), a multidisciplinary co-creation space co-managed by the KIKK Festival, which will make its Protolab (Digital Fabrication Laboratory - Fab Lab) and its Medialab (media lab dedicated to the production of immersive XR, VR, AR, binaural experiences, sound studio) available to residents.
The residents will be able to learn to use the tools of the Fab Lab and will benefit from professional technical assistance. The project could also, with the agreement of the festival team, be presented during an edition of KIKK festival or at Le Pavillon, a new exhibition space managed by KIKK.
During their residency, the artists will have to participate to a cultural activity in which they share details about their work practice or research with the audience of Abattoirs de Bomel, it can be a workshop, a talk, a discussion or anything else. This will be decided with the artists during their stay in Namur.
The grant includes:
A total budget of €10.000 (€5.000 per resident). This includes the expenses for materials, food, and travel for a period of four weeks.
Accommodation (studio from 39 to 47m2) with a bathroom, a kitchenette, an office space and a bedroom space and an internet connection.
Access to the Protolab TRAKK and its machines (3D printers, vinyl cutter, digital milling machine, laser cutter, electronic equipment, woodworking, ...) as well as technical support.
Access to the TRAKK Medialab and its equipment (motion capture suits, VR headsets, computer optimized for game engines, sound studio, binaural microphone heads, ...)
Use of the workshops of the CCN/Centre culture de Namur (on the site of the Abattoirs de Bomel: woodworking, ironwork and silk-screening workshops; assistance and initiation by the technical management)

Two artists and/or collectives will be hosted in residence in the residency studios (2 flats each accommodating up to 4 people) located on the rooftop of the Delta in Namur, Belgium from Sunday 14 May until 14 June Sunday 2023. Each of them will receive a grant of 5.000€ to develop an art/science project on the theme of astronomy, as well as curatorial and scientific support to develop their production project.
The artists will be able to dialogue and exchange with astrophysicists, researchers and the entire community around the Antoine Thomas Observatory. They accept artists from all creative disciplines.
This new astronomical observatory of the University of Namur allows students and the general public to discover the stars with their own eyes and to learn about the sciences and techniques (optics, mechanics, physics, mathematics...) related to their observation. It is specially equipped for the discovery of astronomy in the city, by filtering light pollution. Discover more about the 4 telescopes. The imaging equipment captures objects invisible to the naked eye and allows videos to be made. The observatory also houses a large solar telescope, unique in Wallonia, which allows the sun to be observed in high definition and in complete safety. This observatory is an open window on the infinite, allowing you to explore the Universe from the City (images taken by the telescope). The place also offers a unique view on the Cathedral district and the Citadel of Namur, as well as a unique acoustic.
They are interested in projects that go beyond mere pedagogical explanation; offering a different perspective. They value proposals that connect their phenomenological world with human experiences of wonder and the senses, devices that allow the public to imagine their own story, to ask questions, to discover issues or to formulate a critical opinion, to bring their feelings and experience to science, to enrich it.
The themes addressed can be diverse and varied, while maintaining a link with the sky and the cosmos. Starting from the Sun-Earth-Moon system, going beyond the solar system, reaching the confines of the Milky Way, or distant galaxies, the observation of the sky reveals the layers of the Universe not perceptible by our human senses. It is now possible to cross the barriers of the light spectrum, to listen to cosmic phenomena, to use artificial intelligence to suggest links between phenomena in the universe and other phenomena on a smaller scale. How can we imagine a different perception of time, light and space on the scale of the cosmos? Exoplanets, black holes, comets, storms on planets, gravity, dark matter, space activities, space debris, are all subjects that can form the basis for an artistic project. The use of scientific data as artistic material can give rise to new visual interpretations, sonification or sculptures revealing to us the celestial kinematics of the Universe. Like the dome that welcomes them, the artists also invite us to travel through their work, opening another window on the infinite.
The residents will be able to learn how to use the tools of the Fab Lab and will receive professional technical assistance. The project could also, with the agreement of the festival team, be presented as part of an edition of the KIKK festival or at Le Pavillon, the new exhibition space managed by the KIKK.
At the end of the residency, the artists will take part in an exchange with the public about their work. The format will be determined with the organisers during the residency.
The residency includes a total budget of €10,000 (€5,000 per resident) including the costs generated by the project, the purchase of materials, meals on site and transport costs including airfare for the period of residency.
Also included are two accommodations at the Delta, each accommodating up to 4 people, as well as the provision of the Delta's technical means or aids (technical team, a stage, an exhibition room, a recording studio), and access to the TRAKK Protolab and its machines (3D printers, vinyl cutter, digital milling machine, laser cutter, electronic equipment, woodworking, etc.) as well as technical support.

The residency will take place from September 3-10th, 2023. Curators will be offered per diems as well as travel and accommodation costs in Turku, Finland during the festival.
The focus of the residency is to offer emerging curators, with less than approximately 5 years of working experience, a chance to attend the festival, learn from other curators, and to grow one’s own professional networks. The curators are also expected to attend pitch sessions, panel discussions, and workshops organised by Eskus and NPT during the festival, as well as preparatory Zoom meetings before the residency. Finnish and Finland-based curators are also eligible to apply for the residency.
New Performance Turku Biennale - NPT is an event showcasing the current streams and phenomena in performance art. The Biennale will continue the work done through the 10-year history of the renowned NPT Festival (2012-2021), developing means of production and audience in the field of performance art. The program accommodates both residencies and process-based collaborations amongst practitioners with local venues and agencies.

In a world where 75% of the Earth’s land area is under the direct human influence the way we understand and imagine the planet has a fundamental impact on the environment. Imagining the future of our planet is based on underlying concepts, value systems, visual cultures, and technologies used to describe the Earth’s environment.
What new perspectives, knowledge, and novel solutions can we imagine in an era of accelerating environmental change? The Earth’s climate is changing at an unprecedented rate due to human influence. The man-made technosphere is merging with the cycle of life from microbes down to Earth’s bedrock and from the depths of the oceans to the atmosphere and space, resulting in an interdependent, hybrid environment. We must change the way we do things in terms of energy, resources, and the living environment – to name but a few of the challenges – and adopt more sustainable practices. How to adapt to the changes that are already happening? How to prepare for those that are likely to come? What is the role of local knowledge, on one hand, and information acquired from space, the depths of the earth, and through satellites and remote sensing, on the other, in describing our hybrid landscapes and lifeforms?
The residency programme calls for artists and workgroups who approach future studies, change detection, and environmental change broadly through art and science. The More-than-Planet project and its residency programmes aim to re-examine our understanding of the bigger picture on the planetary level. The themes of the residency are observation of environmental change and artistic exploration of alternative futures and solutions through questions concerning climate, ecology, land use patterns, water ecology, the carbon cycle and social and cultural change. We look for artists who develop and challenge traditional forms of collaboration of art and science, questioning and offering new perspectives. The artists are expected to work in collaboration with both researchers and local communities. The residency is open to all forms of art but places an emphasis on artistic practices that employ lens-based techniques. The residencies will take place in 2023 and 2024.
This open call for artists seeks proposals that open new perspectives and develop novel ideas for works that draw on different methods, technologies, scenarios, and identifiable experiences leading to a deeper and broader picture of the change and the solutions it calls for.
The artist or the group selected will be invited to a two-month residency for artistic research and exploration at the:
1) Callio Lab underground research station in Pyhäsalmi mine and the surrounding communities, or;
2) the multidisciplinary research station in Oulanka National Park and the local communities. Our satellite and remote sensing data collaboration partner is the European Space Agency’s earth observation unit ESRIN (ESA Centre for Earth Observation) located in Frascati, Italy.
The artist or group will be paid a total of 15,000 EUR for a two-month period of residency and independent work resulting in a new artwork. The residency period will run from April 2023 to May 2024. The residency programme will finance the accommodation and travel expenses of the participants and support the production of the works in terms of content, production and technology. The duration of the continuous working period in the residency location is 2-4 weeks depending on the situation, contract, and schedules.
During the residency, the artist will create a new work or body of works for the More-than-Planet exhibition at the gallery of Photo North – Northern Photographic Centre in Oulu, Finland in autumn 2024. The works will also be part of the Photo North – Nordic Photographic Centre’s Oulu European Capital of Culture 2026 project.
In addition, the residency projects of the More-than-Planet project aim for participation in the Ars Electronica festival in Linz, Austria in September 2023, where the processes and the finished works (if available) will be presented. Ars Electronica is an annual digital art festival that explores the future through art, technology, and social phenomena.
The resident artists are selected by a jury of four members: Antti Tenetz, More-than-Planet project manager (Photo North – Northern Photographic Centre), Darja Zaitsev, executive director, curator (Photo North – Northern Photographic Centre), and Emmi Itäranta renowned Finnish fiction author.
In addition to the artistic portfolio of the applicant or the group, the selection will be based on evaluation of the concept of the work, its artistic quality, the feasibility of the plan and its relation to the themes of the residencies of the More-than-Planet project. We welcome mind-blowing, novel ways of thinking and provocative perspectives. The jury may contact the applicants for further information prior to selection. The implementation and the content of the works will be developed in collaboration with the project participants.

Rejmyre has, since 2009, played host to a long-term, place-based, artistic research project with a focus on site-responsive practice.
One of the organisation’s primary research themes has, since 2018, been refuging: an exploration of how giving/taking refuge, as an act and practice, can be developed and facilitated through multiple artistic interactions and interventions. The theme has been developed by the project’s research leader Daniel Peltz, who, together with artistic director Sissi Westerberg, will introduce the theme and projects developed thus far during the ensemble residency week.
Refuging is a call to action for artists to develop the practice of giving/taking refuge. The initiator of this project, the U.S./Swedish artist Daniel Peltz, asks you to reconsider the notion of refuge, not as a noun (a refuge, a refugee, etc.) but as a verb, as a vital, inherently reciprocal set of actions. He asks “how might we, as artists, use this thin sliver of time, while the worst impacts of climate change are still in the future, to develop our capacity as a society to give and to take refuge?” Refuging takes the form of a series of productions-in-residence, that will result in a broadly distributed refuging toolkit, a set of artist-shaped models for how to do this complicated work of refuging. Peltz writes, “perhaps in the not-too-distant future, people facing the need to refuge will pick up this toolkit and say, ‘I heard they tried it this way in Rejmyre.’”
One question that has become central to Peltz’ thinking around refuging is: How does a factory town that produces glass, become a factory town that produces refuge? Here Peltz references and is responding to the appropriation of small towns like Rejmyre as temporary refuges for newly arrived people, while ‘better housing’ was built for them in, implicitly, ‘better places’. Peltz, who has been investigating the town of Rejmyre for over 15 years, challenges the logic of this articulation. He asks, What if this was actually a better place than many to do this thing called refuging? Here he performs a shift on our usual association with the word ‘refuge’, moving it from a noun, referring to people and places, to a verb referring to a set of actions. In this shift refuging expands to become a practice that encompasses everyone. The subject positions of the refugee who comes seeking refuge and the one who gives refuge collapse and we are left with a reciprocal state that we all might learn to perform and inhabit better. Further, Peltz makes a claim that sites like Rejmyre, that have been used up in the cycle of extraction, depletion and abandonment, are not just good enough places to house refugees but places that are uniquely well suited to developing the practice of refuging because they themselves are in need of refuge.
The residency consists of a funded eight-week working period, with six weeks on-site in Rejmyre:
One week of Ensemble Residency (for more on this structure see below): April 24-30, 2023
Individual research and production on-site in Rejmyre: May 1 - June 5, 2023
Reflection and post-production, off-site: Two weeks of work spread out over the summer & autumn of 2023.
They invite artists, working in any medium, who are interested in engaging their practices in exploring the research topic of ‘refuging’ (for more on the research topic see below) to apply. They offer support for the participation of:
Two artists from any country outside of the Nordic/Baltic region
Two artists from the Nordic/Baltic region (outside of Sweden)
Two regional artists based in Östergötland, Sweden
They look forward to having a diverse cohort of practitioners and thereby offer three types of support:
Artist Residency for international applicants beyond the Nordic and Baltic regions (funded by IASPIS): Participation stipend of 24 000 SEK, material/production stipend up to 12 500 SEK, travel stipend, housing in Rejmyre (individual bedrooms with shared bathroom and shared communal spaces), shared production space in historic early 20th century factory buildings with the possibility of individual (bookable) space + 1 communal lunch per week
Artist Residency for Nordic and Baltic artists (funded by Nordic Culture Point) : Participation stipend of 24 000 SEK, material/production stipend up to 12 500 SEK, travel stipend, housing in Rejmyre (individual bedrooms with shared bathroom and shared communal spaces), shared production space in historic early 20th century factory buildings with the possibility of individual (bookable) space + 1 communal lunch per week
Artist Residency for regional and local artists of Östergötland (funded by Kulturrådet, Region Östergötland, Finspångs kommun): We invite artists in the vicinity of Östergötland to participate in the Refuging Production Residency by offering studio space in the Refuging Pavilion in Rejmyre to compliment their practice. They seek artists who are able to be present for the Ensemble Residency week as well as at least 2 days/week during the residency period but who do not need overnight accommodations. Participation stipend of 10 000 SEK ex. VAT, material budget up to 5000 SEK, a travel budget of 1500 sek, studio space within the shared Refuging Pavilion, a conceptual art work created by artist Daniel Peltz in collaboration with Danish architect Atelier Kristoffer Tejlgaard + 1 communal lunch per week
Please note that all artists will be present during the same time in Rejmyre. In connection to this residency there will also be an autumn presentation in our exhibition space, Engelska Magasinet, in Rejmyre, of the individual and shared processes and practices produced during the residency: September 23 - November 5, 2023. Exhibition fees following the Swedish MU agreement will be applied.
They encourage all professionals working within the contemporary art and craft fields to apply online.

Here Peltz references and is responding to the appropriation of small towns like Rejmyre as temporary refuges for newly arrived people, while ‘better housing’ was built for them in, implicitly, ‘better places’. Peltz, who has been investigating the town of Rejmyre for over 15 years, challenges the logic of this articulation. He asks, What if this was actually a better place than many to do this thing called refuging? Here he performs a shift on our usual association with the word ‘refuge’, moving it from a noun, referring to people and places, to a verb referring to a set of actions. In this shift refuging expands to become a practice that encompasses everyone. The subject positions of the refugee who comes seeking refuge and the one who gives refuge collapse and we are left with a reciprocal state that we all might learn to perform and inhabit better. Further, Peltz makes a claim that sites like Rejmyre, that have been used up in the cycle of extraction, depletion and abandonment, are not just good enough places to house refugees but places that are uniquely well suited to developing the practice of refuging because they themselves are in need of refuge.</p><p>The residency consists of a funded eight-week working period, with six weeks on-site in Rejmyre:</p><ul><li>One week of Ensemble Residency (for more on this structure see below): April 24-30, 2023</li><li>Individual research and production on-site in Rejmyre: May 1 - June 5, 2023</li><li>Reflection and post-production, off-site: Two weeks of work spread out over the summer &amp; autumn of 2023.</li></ul><p>They invite artists, working in any medium, who are interested in engaging their practices in exploring the research topic of ‘refuging’ (for more on the research topic see below) to apply.

Cripta747 is a non-profit visual art organisation founded in Turin in 2008: it is a place for research, exchange and production where the artistic practices face the contemporary debate. Through a programme of exhibitions, screenings and events, CRIPTA747 investigates new forms and languages ​​with the aim of giving back to the audience an authentic and fresh vision. Since 2017, they have started two new programmes dedicated to international mobility: Residency, to support research with fellowships, and Studio, a project of shared work space with a focus on production.
Cripta747 Residency Programme is aimed at those who demonstrate strong, coherent, and recognizable research in both the work's conceptual development and material production. The residency values the research process and redefines the modalities of disseminating artistic, critical, and curatorial practices in a context free of exhibition restraints. The program is structured to encourage study and research activities by providing easy access to the area's cultural, bibliographic, and archival heritage and its productive network through meetings with professionals, scholars, experts, and artisans in the city.
The projects submitted do not necessarily have to be completed by the end of December; rather, they see the months of residency as an initial research phase of a larger work. Particular attention will be paid to proposals that show a transdisciplinary approach and open up to areas of knowledge also not strictly related to the artistic sphere.
Applicants are invited to submit a proposal outlining the specific research they intend to develop during their residency, specifying the expected benefits of this experience and envisaging the possible collaborations necessary for the project's development.
In addition, applicants are asked to propose an idea for an event to be realized by the end of their stay (a workshop, a lecture, a cycle of projections, a performance, etc.), that directly involves the public.
The winner will be selected by a scientific committee that will work alongside the curatorial team of Cripta747 for the entire season and will accompany the artist for the duration of the residency.

In 2021 the first iteration of the Digital Diasporas was launched as a distributed, remote residency that gave artists the space to research, cultivate their practice, and convene across borders. Last year's residents Tian Zhang, Amy Lam, and Casey Tang inspired many generative conversations and long-lasting connections about colonialisms in multiple contexts, sustainability and equity in arts practices, and all the ways in which humans, non-humans, and ecologies coexist in all relations.
Digital Diasporas was a spacious opportunity for artists to do deep thinking and form cross-border connections without the pressure of producing a final product. This year, they are excited to bring back this open call for a second iteration with an additional residency host in the United States.
They want to hear from artists, collectives, and curators who self-identify and find it useful to gather under a ""Sino and/or Chinese diaspora"" cohort. This is a time for research, exploration, and learning. They are looking for openness to collective, intercultural, and cross-border development and research.
They welcome experimental, digital, and/or research-based practices, and people who feel an alignment with and interest in any or all of the host organisations' networks and programming. They are especially interested in ideas that explore diasporic cultures and spaces, flows of people, goods and capital, alternative community and kin-making, digital cultures, media arts, philosophies of technology and place-making—and any intersections of these.
Everyone is encouraged to apply, especially if you have never applied to anything in the past. They are particularly interested in applications that resist and interrogate stereotypical or reactionary impulses, instead turning our gaze towards the difficult but necessary conversations, care, and solidarities we might build across borders.
Digital Diasporas will host:
one person or collective who self-identifies as Chinese and/or Sino diaspora in or from Australia (citizen or permanent resident)
one person or collective who self-identifies as Chinese and/or Sino diaspora in or from Canada (citizen or permanent resident)
one person or collective who self-identifies as Chinese and/or Sino, regardless of what passport they hold or where they reside
The remote, six-week-long online residency will be facilitated by three host organisations in May and June. Each resident or collective will primarily work with one host organisation in Australia, Canada, or the United States and all residents as a cohort will be in dialogue with one another through convenings. Each resident or collective will be awarded an unrestricted stipend of AUD $10,000 for their participation (CAD $10,000 for the Gendai Resident). Each host organisation will design a program of remote/online mentoring, networking, research, and development for the resident they host.
The host organisations are:
4A Centre for Contemporary Asian Art (Sydney, Australia / the ancestral lands of the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation)
Gendai (Toronto, Canada / the ancestral territory of many nations including the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishnabeg, the Chippewa, the Haudenosaunee and the Wendat peoples and now home to many diverse First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples)
Asian Arts Initiative (Philadelphia, USA / ancestral homelands of the Lenape peoples)
This Digital Diasporas Global Residencies is initiated and funded by the Australian Council for the Arts and supported by the National Foundation for Australia-China Relations, and Canada Council for the Arts.

The program acts as both, a platform for production and reflection on contemporary artistic practices and a link between the invited artists and the City of Buenos Aires´ rich cultural community. Through production, research and urban-community intervention residencies, it fosters interrelationships t with other artists and contexts, promoting exchange, discussion, experimentation and collaborative work. At the same time, the programme generates and expands artistic-cultural networks at national and international level.
'Ace's flagship residence encourages the exploration of ground-breaking forms in contemporary artistic practices by offering facilities and support to produce new projects. This residency offers 4 weeks of artistic ‘time out’ in one of the world’s most vibrant and cosmopolitan cities. Artists may work on individual or collaborative projects proposed by themselves.
The Production Residencies aims to support emerging and career artists within the Visual Arts for the production/creation of either new works (which may include an exhibition/site-specific installation) or a work in progress adapted for the local context. All kinds of projects are welcome.
However, due to its facilities and expertise, ´ace pays special attention to those proposals that question the singularity of the art object by using the reproducible capacity of printmaking, photography, new media, design, and/or their interfaces, blurring their boundaries.
The programme is intended to foster personal vision by offering professional and emerging artists a unique opportunity to create without interruption. ´ace team and associated professionals do support the creative process by way of facilities, mentorships, and services in the creative studio. The residents will expand their art and experience by making contact with Argentine and other international artists while working in the dynamic environment that the city of Buenos Aires provides.

The exhibition looks for points of contact between people, technology and nature. The technological art installations consisting of sounds, lights, texts, sculptures or their online counterparts are placed in natural spaces like forests, fields, swamps and lakes.
With this open call Maajaam is seeking proposals for installations, interventions or processes to be installed in landscapes spread out around Maajaam that explore the human condition in a contemporary technological society. The artworks should withstand outdoor conditions. They encourage artists to think of solutions that are energy sustainable: use alternative sources (e.g. solar panels) and be as economical as possible.
The residency will take place between June and August of 2023. The residency lasts for approximately 3 weeks, depending on your production plan. The produced works will remain in Maajaam until 2025. By participating in this open call, the artist agrees that their works can be also displayed in satellite exhibits in Latvia (partner Savvala) and Estonia.
In total they will select three to five projects for the 2023 residency period. They are open to all artists from around the world. Selected projects receive an artist fee of €2000 (per project) and a travel grant. The total maximum production budget per project can be up to €5000 (please submit a preliminary budget). The production will be assisted by organizers by providing some production facilities, tools (see the list here), specialized know-how and a smoke sauna experience.
Main selection criteria:
suitability of the idea considering the assignment
feasibility of the production plan
environmental impact of the project
project’s ability to relate to the surrounding landscape
Residency production camp will take place between June and August 2023 in Maajaam. As an exception we can organize one or two individual residencies on other dates.
The selected works for this call are partly funded by Tartu 2024 European Capital of Culture.
The artworks will be presented in 2024 at Maajaam open air art park in South Estonia and remain accessible for the audience for around 4 months (with a possibility to extend to 2025). Some selected artworks will also be premiered to Latvian audiences in summer of 2023 in Savvala, North Latvia, Vidzeme.

It aims at bringing together artists, writers, curators, thinkers, activists, chefs, farmers, designers, and many more to explore non-conventional food practices.
The program focuses on food-related practices and topics, questioning conventional food practices and exploring as well as exchanging new agricultural and culinary knowledge. It also focuses on the practical skills needed to cultivate food and collect or disseminate seeds, research relating to livestock and the economics of alimentation, and the hegemony of industrialized practices in food production and distribution worldwide. There are no limitations for disciplines to involve. Topics can range from the preservation of biodiversity, urban agriculture, cultivation of local native and non-native varieties, or the mismanagement of water reserves to the possibility of creating distribution networks and fostering economic viability through alternative practices.
There are two specific phases:
Generative Phase brings together nine artists, thinkers, researchers, activists, chefs, farmers, anthropologists, designers, and other cultural practitioners to spend one week in each of the three participating cities. Each hub will select three residents from their wider region. The travel period will be between March and May 2023. During this period residents will meet the local scenes and convene for artist-led workshops, performances, artist talks and screenings, networking sessions, music events, meetings with activists, thematic tours, cooking sessions, and more.
Production Phase will follow in the autumn of 2023. All residents are invited, without obligation, to submit a proposal for a project involving at least two of the visited Hubs. The proposal will be evaluated, and if supported, stipends will be made available to realize the project with a dedicated production budget. Curatorial and production support will be given in all stages to accompany the project's development by the hub and local partners selected together. The funding will be agreed upon individually based on the specific proposal.","","","<div class=""field field--name-field-body field--type-entity-reference-revisions field--label-hidden field__items""><div class=field__item> <div class=""paragraph paragraph--type--text paragraph--view-mode--full""><div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-paragraph-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item""><p><a href=https://allianzfoundation.org/residency-on-the-road rel=noopener target=_blank>""Decolonizing Food: Water, Land and Heritage""</a> is the first edition of Residency On The Road, the unique Allianz Foundation Hubs residency program.

The first residency artist, Juan Duarte, is Mexican artist based in Finland, who works with environmental sound to explore sensing in-between nature and technology. His work deals with developing methods for augmented listening, which combine machine learning with remote sensing, in order to explore how computers could deep-listen to expand human sensorium.
The call is open for the second and third residencies of the new Residency Program for Baltic and Nordic artists who work on the edge of art, science and techno-ecologies, exploring the complex relations between the human, nature and digital technologies, and focusing on new concepts such as “naturecultures”, “sensing environments”, “living technologies”, “terrestrial coexistence”, “naturally / artificial intelligences”, which recently have beenre-examined at the heart of our society.
Three Art, Science and Techno-Ecologies residencies, two-month each, for Baltic and Nordic artists will take place at RIXC in Riga, Latvia, during the time period from February 1, 2023 until March 31, 2024, supported by NCP (Nordic Culture Point). The three fully-funded Baltic-Nordic Artist Residencies will also include a trip and short-stay visits to RIXC Fields residency (in rural area) and their partner location – at the Irbene Radiotelescope.

‘Foreign’ does not only describe something from abroad but also relates to objects and conditions that appear unfamiliar, unaccustomed and unexplored. As the start of a dialogue and exchange, ‘Something Foreign’ brings about inspirations from things external to one’s original experience, simply out of the unknown.
‘Something Foreign’, as the programme title itself suggests, works as a ‘foreign-er’ to generate and aggregate a collective of curiosities and senses among artists and cultural practitioners who would reset themselves to observe, listen and reflect. Journeying through uncharted waters, the idea is to (re)discover something new, and to venture out to an unimagined fathom.
‘Something Foreign’ seeks to bolster and renew inspiration to a local arts community by importing ‘foreign things’. The dedicated International Artists-in-Residence programme is scoped to bring in unfamiliar and unexpected ideas, practices and cultures.
The programme serves as a platform for cross-cultural dialogue, and for sharing of identities, values and visions, in the shaping of arts. It provides an opportunity to build lasting connections on ideas and experience sharing between people.
Programme structure and special features:
Two seasons a year: Spring (April/May) and Autumn (October/November) every year.
1-2 international artists each season.
4-6 weeks of residence.
Performative Presentation (1st week) and Experience Sharing (last week) of residency.
Exchange with local arts practitioners during residency.
Jamming, workshops and other experiments with local artists (can be arranged, upon the needs of the visiting artists).
Mentorship for students of co-organising organisation (students as research/project assistants for the visiting artists).
Support for the visiting artists:
Round-trip international flight.
Accommodation of 4 to 6 weeks.
Living allowance during the residence.
Additional research allowance during the residence.
Studio space.
Technical support.
Organising the performative presentation and experience sharing with the visiting artists.
Assistance in networking with local arts professionals.
Providing advice and assistance on the research/experiments initiated by the visiting artist.
The programme is open to interdisciplinary, performance, media art, visual arts, and music, and to artists who are interested in collaboration with art professionals of other medium and disciplines.
Please send the following info to the organisation (nodisciplineltd[at]gmail.com) with the subject:

Departing mainly from a critique of western modernity and coloniality which enabled capitalism and subsequent environmental and racial injustice, these forms of critique are not directly applicable to the contexts of Eastern Europe and its states, which were a part of the Soviet modernity that operated within different economical and political models. Situated between imperial powers — coming from Western Europe and the Russian Empire, the lands of these states have been subjected to colonial and neo-colonial gazes that mapped and visualized these territories in their own ways, while rendering them into sites of material transactions and operational spaces where bodies, lands, living and non-living matter were cast as resources.
Nida Art Colony of Vilnius Academy of Arts (NAC) is looking for cultural practitioners researching the Baltic States to join a two-week residency at NAC in Nida, Lithuania. The residency will provide participants with the opportunity to connect, exchange, and share their practice with a small number of practitioners from Ukraine and the Baltic States. The goal of the residency is to look together at various specific sites — be it the Curonian Spit in Lithuania, Donbas in Ukraine, or approximations, such as Eastern Europe — and to think about the longer histories of sociotechnical imaginaries and spatial arrangements that inscribe themselves in bodies and lands, imagined as a component of material exchange.
By securing time to be and think together, the intention is to collectively reflect on gaps in knowledge that obscure or mute these territories, their histories, and the material aspects of colonial rendering of these lands into a resource. The goal is to address the sociotechnical arrangements and spatial organizations that enable slow violence and environmental damage while equating the human population and life at large to geological, agricultural, and other forms of matter with usable material capacities.
Throughout the two weeks, participants will share their existing work as well as work-in-progress research with the aim to contribute to a laboratory of practices and ideas through fieldwork, screenings, lectures, and discussions. During the residency, a shared vocabulary and bibliography will be developed that supports the production of situated knowledge within these contexts.
Participant’s contribution throughout the residency: artist talk or lecture, working on an individual project, or a collective work-in-progress presentation.
Participant’s contribution upon completion (by May 2023): a text or a visual essay to be published on the NAC website.
Participation is open to professionals working in the field of culture, academic researchers, PhD students, and Postdoc researchers with a focus on the Baltic States. NAC covers travel costs up to 250€ and an individual residency stipend of 800€. Please reach out to them by completing this online form.

Their residents concentrate on a wide range of specialisations, disciplines and practices, but come together to live and work in the Northern Peninsula of Ishigaki Island, Japan. The programme is intended to create a lively platform; to collect, discuss, and experiment with the land, the ocean, and nearby communities. Ishigaki, an island of the Yaeyama Islands in southern Ryukyu, is about 440 kilometres southwest of Okinawa and 240 kilometres east of Taiwan. Ishigaki and the seven islands composing the Yaeyama archipelago are situated on the far southern edge of Okinawa prefecture.
Residencies are short-term and operate as a seed. In time a new community of residents is created and encouraged to be back to the island for future projects. MA UMI RESIDENCIES is not results-driven. Residents have the possibility to present their work through an exhibition, a performance, a workshop or lead a similar event during their stay. The minimum requirement is a public presentation of their past research work and residency reflection to the local community.
Green Rabbit (est. 2012) is MA UMI’s base, creative home and permacultural project space nested in the forest. In 2022, an additional living workshop and terrace were annexed to the main building to accommodate new, land-related activities. An edible forest and permaculture garden, for instance, were developed to provide a space for critical observation of the project, conceptually and technically. The garden is enhanced with herbs and medicinal plants that are locally renowned to improve one’s health and diet. Green Rabbit is thus particularly impactful for permaculturists and artists who seek tangible exposure to their lifework.
Pink Turtle is both a home and workshop now under construction. Located across the road from Green Rabbit, it is immersed in a primary forest, mangrove, beach, and coral reef. An assemblage of pink concrete structures cascades down the slope with an imbrication of terraces above the sea. A large, protective roof provides the framework for the two buildings, weaving public and private areas together. In reference to a turtle shell sheltering everyone from the sun, rain, and typhoons, the roof interlocks with the lower terrace and the ocean space directly facing the ocean. The surrounding environment will provide marine biologists, free divers, and artists with conditions to build collective knowledge about the interdependence with the Ocean.
Blue Seahorse is a new initiative located in Hirakubo, a small, remote village stretching between farmlands and secluded beaches. The residence includes a small house and light guest house, mostly opened in the garden; glass and panels hinge at the top like flap closing during typhoons. An immersive holistic food lab will work closely with the land and community to develop innovative edible experiences. This offers a unique opportunity for chefs and culinary artists to collaborate and push cross-disciplinary boundaries.
MA Umi Residencies is not results-driven. Residents have the possibility to present their work though an exhibition, a performance, a workshop or lead a similar event during their stay. The minimum requirement is a public presentation of their past research work and residency reflection to the local community. They also encourage intercultural collaborations with their network of local partners and contacts, as appropriate to each resident’s particular interests.
Professionals and students are invited to apply.

Their residents concentrate on a wide range of specialisations, disciplines and practices, but come together to live and work in the Northern Peninsula of Ishigaki Island, Japan. The programme is intended to create a lively platform; to collect, discuss, and experiment with the land, the ocean, and nearby communities. Ishigaki, an island of the Yaeyama Islands in southern Ryukyu, is about 440 kilometres southwest of Okinawa and 240 kilometres east of Taiwan. Ishigaki and the seven islands composing the Yaeyama archipelago are situated on the far southern edge of Okinawa prefecture. </p><p>Residencies are short-term and operate as a seed. In time a new community of residents is created and encouraged to be back to the island for future projects. MA UMI RESIDENCIES is not results-driven.

In 2022, an additional living workshop and terrace were annexed to the main building to accommodate new, land-related activities. An edible forest and permaculture garden, for instance, were developed to provide a space for critical observation of the project, conceptually and technically. The garden is enhanced with herbs and medicinal plants that are locally renowned to improve one’s health and diet. Green Rabbit is thus particularly impactful for permaculturists and artists who seek tangible exposure to their lifework.</p><p>Pink Turtle is both a home and workshop now under construction. Located across the road from Green Rabbit, it is immersed in a primary forest, mangrove, beach, and coral reef. An assemblage of pink concrete structures cascades down the slope with an imbrication of terraces above the sea. A large, protective roof provides the framework for the two buildings, weaving public and private areas together. In reference to a turtle shell sheltering everyone from the sun, rain, and typhoons, the roof interlocks with the lower terrace and the ocean space directly facing the ocean. The surrounding environment will provide marine biologists, free divers, and artists with conditions to build collective knowledge about the interdependence with the Ocean.</p><p>Blue Seahorse is a new initiative located in Hirakubo, a small, remote village stretching between farmlands and secluded beaches. The residence includes a small house and light guest house, mostly opened in the garden; glass and panels hinge at the top like flap closing during typhoons. An immersive holistic food lab will work closely with the land and community to develop innovative edible experiences.

The Centre national de la danse x Cité internationale des arts residency is open to choreographers of all nationalities, working and living outside of France (French overseas territories excluded).
The Centre national de la danse (CND) is unique in that it brings together in a single establishment a wide range of professional activities, from professional dance training to career advice, while also appealing to the general public. As a public establishment, founded thanks to the initiative of the French Ministry of Culture, the CND brings together all of the resources aimed at the sector of choreography and its public. It accompanies and trains professional dancers, enhances amateur practice, assists research, conserves and distributes choreographic heritage, and supports the creation of choreographic works in all their diversity and dialogues with other artistic fields. The expert, accessible teams of the departments of the CND develop resources, transmit knowhow and knowledge, and accompany professionals, amateurs and creative artists, while also dialoguing with the sector and the public in an exploratory dynamic so as to assist in the development of dance in the best possible way. Firmly based in Pantin, on the outskirts of Paris, as well as in Lyon and Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, the premises of the CND are genuine agorae that federate and favour exchanges. The CND is open to the world and presents both on the international scene and in France, reaching out to one and all through its innovative, mobile schemes. Being both a pioneer and a repository of the memory of dance, the CND constructs a common space, while developing and encouraging initiatives. It is in motion alongside artists, professionals and the public.
The Cité internationale des arts is an artist residency that brings together artists in the heart of Paris and allows them to implement a creative or research project in all disciplines. From two months to a year, the Cité internationale des arts allows artists to work in a favourable environment for artistic creation, and to meet cultural professionals. The team of the Cité internationale des arts provides residents with individual support. In the Marais or in Montmartre, the live-in studios (spaces for living and creating) allow residents to cohabit with more than 300 artists and art professionals of all generations, nationalities and disciplines. In collaboration with its many partners, the Cité internationale des arts opens several calls for applications on specific themes and/or projects throughout the year.
The purpose of this residency is to promote the mobility of professionals and to enlarge their network. For the choreographer, it is an opportunity to make their work known in France and to expand their research. With this programme, the CND and the Cité internationale des arts are committed to supporting the project of each laureate by allowing the choreographer to benefit from a privileged accompaniment and a three-month residency in Paris and Pantin.
With a surface area ranging from 25 to 60m2, the studio apartments are designed to combine production and daily life. They consist of a work room, a kitchen, a bathroom and a sleeping area. A live-in studio can accommodate up to two adults and a child up to 7 years old.
Unfortunately, the proposed live-in studio does not meet current accessibility standards for people with disabilities, and the organisation is working on this for the future. If you have any questions about the accessibility of the Cité internationale des arts, they are at your disposal. CND studios are 60 to 200 m2 area.
The recipient will benefit from:
A three-month artistic residency, either from March to May 2023 or from September to November 2023 at the Cité internationale des arts, in a studio with workplace and a furnished living place (bedroom, shower, kitchen, wifi), located in the heart of Paris.
A studio time, at the Centre national de la danse at Pantin, located North-Est of Paris.
A specific artistic and professional accompaniment: access to the networks and documentary resources of the two partners.
The programme includes:
International transportation to and from Paris with a VISA and travel insurance.
A grant for living expenses: 1 000 euros /month.
A production grant: 1 500 euros.
A presentation event, to be defined according to the laureate's project.

With the opening of the final exhibition spaces at the Humboldt Forum Berlin, the museums aim to continue and strengthen their collaborative approach. The inclusion of artistic thinking and research is fundamental to this, and the promotion of collaboration and mutually productive space for artists, researchers and curators is central. The starting point for the artistic research is the exhibition “Den Westen entdecken (Discovery of the West)”. It deals with the reception, appropriation and reinterpretation of ideas associated with the ‘West’ in the Ottoman and Persian Empires at the end of the 19th century. Reports from the world exhibitions in Vienna and Paris were received with interest, but also critically in Tehran, Istanbul, Damascus and Cairo. Using the examples of urban redevelopment, fashion and furniture design, the exhibition focuses on how new impressions took shape in the material and visual cultures of these cosmopolitan urban centres and how they led to concrete and far-reaching political steps. Changes in gender roles and social change are also manifest in the objects.
As part of the residency, artists are invited to engage with the themes and objects of the exhibition and
explore their meanings for the 21st century. In doing so, the creative and material aspects of the works
could be considered as well as their inherent transcultural or political underpinnings. The manifold
connections in the fields of art and politics, the views of the ‘West’, but also the new political alliances
emerging with the independence movements could be further starting points. Artists of all media are
invited. Due to the thematic orientation, but also the spatial conditions (high showcase back walls and
an open space with daylight and a view of the cityscape), painting/graphics, video or installation works,
including design works, are particularly welcome.
Activities and outcome:
The art residency is awarded for a period of three months during the first half of 2023.
During this time, the artist will further develop the submitted project and create a work that will be exhibited at the museum in 2023. A purchase is conceivable.
Creation of documentation of the work process including sketches, photographs and small texts to be used in a small publication (booklet).
The working language is English.
Participation in a public event in a format of the artist's choice at the museum.
The residency includes:
Stipend: 8.500 € (including taxes and health insurance)
Travel expenses are all-inclusive to/from and in Berlin (including visa fees and possible corona tests: 1.500 €).
Production budget depending on the project and possible purchase.
A small working space, access to the museum's object and photo collection, archive and library, and sound studio.
Curatorial supervision and technical and administrative support.
The application should contain:
CV and short artistic statement (max. 2 A4 pages)
Concept incl. work plan in relation to the thematic focus (max. 3 A4 pages)

It is located in the heart of the Parque Natural Sierra María - Los Vélez, in the north of the province of Almería, Andalucía. Joya: AiR offers abundant time and space for residents to make, think, explore and learn from their surroundings.
Joya: AiR supports a range of disciplines including, but not limited to, visual art, writing, music, dance, curatorial and film. Founded by Simon and Donna Beckmann in 2009, the Joya: arte + ecología / AiR programme is grounded in the foundation that dynamic and sustainable creative activity is the backbone of regenerating the land that has been slowly abandoned over the last fifty years.
Since 2009, Joya: AiR has welcomed over 800 artists and creatives to realise their projects within one of the most unique and beautiful regions of Spain.
Residents have access to individual studio space and 20 hectares of land. Accommodation (private room with attached bathroom) and meals are included, as is the collection and return to the nearest public transport system.
Their food is local and homemade. Five nights a week they prepare a one-pot meal which residents can share and add something of their own from the food they provide. Two nights a week they prepare supper for everyone so they can gather together and share food in a communal atmosphere.
Selected artists are invited to contribute to the Joya: artists listing and are asked to contribute a small text outlining the nature of their practice whilst in residency. This will be posted to the Joya: website along with a link to the artists' website.
Selected artists are requested to make a presentation of their work to other artists in residence during their period at Joya: AiR. This is not obligatory, but it does contribute to the overall experience of all artists in residence.
Joya’s working languages are English and Spanish.
The length of the residency would be 1 to 2 weeks (longer periods are also available).
The experience of previous resident artists strongly indicates that a two-week residency is much more preferable and productive than one.
The Joya: AiR residency has a fee of €350 per week + tax (10%). This covers the cost of accommodation, studio space and all meals. It also includes collection from the nearest transport hub, Vélez Rubio.
Access to satellite broadband: There is an additional fee of €10 per week (€1.42 per day) please indicate on the application form below if you require internet.
The Joya: AiR minimum deposit is equal to one week's residency €350 + tax (10%) per person or 50% of the fee for longer residency durations.

Narva Art Residency is a cultural space that operates thanks to a collaboration between the Estonian Academy of Arts, Narva Gate, and the Estonian Ministry of Culture. NART initiates and facilitates residencies, art exhibitions, and public events of many kinds, and hosts educational activities. It is a vibrant centre which welcomes a multitude of visitors and guests and has become close to the Narva community. There is a short video about NART here. The creative centre also goes beyond its walls with the projects like Kreenholm garden and the Narva Venice Embassy experiment.
The residency is located in the Estonian-Russian border city of Narva. Due to its location and the current geopolitical situation, the city has become a point of attention and as well a place where Ukrainian refugees enter Europe. NART is in the historic Kreenholm area which came about when a textile manufacturing company was founded in the mid-19th century. It was once the largest of its kind in Europe and Russia. Now it stands vacant but has become a source of inspiration for artists and a space allowing experiments. NART is housed in a historic villa, which was once home to the director of the factory.
The international artist-in-residence program is open for artists and creatives operating across all arts – visual arts, music, performance, architecture, design, film, literature, and curatorial practices etc. The program aims to generate creative exchange between practitioners as well as strengthen ties with the local context. Artists are invited to make interactive, socially engaged, and/or community-based work which is relevant also to the locals of Narva. The engagement can be an event, a workshop or a showing of the final results but even better if the engagement is already intertwined into the process of artmaking itself. The planned practice should be outlined in the application form. For example, in 2022 NART hosted Finnish sound artist Jaakko Autio who created a sound installation which included the input of three local choirs. German designer Leah Schulze did her fieldwork at Narva’s care home to design games for people with dementia and Mexican artists Elizabeth Guerrero recorded the stories of locals in Kulgu area for a sound journey.
NART fosters residencies of approximately 2 months. Both single artists and artistic duos are welcome. Applicants will be selected by an invited committee. NART will contact successful applicants in December 2022 who will sign a contract to set the time of stay at the residency.
The residency offers free accommodation, working space, a shared kitchen, and access to the Kreenholm factory. Residents get help to reach out to communities. NART gives a letter of confirmation for artists who apply for outsourced funds but does not involve financial obligations or support (the resident does not have to pay a fee to NART, and there is no working grant, travel funding, or production budget from NART). Residents have the possibility to propose exhibitions or events for NART gallery spaces. We can offer the space for free, but finances and production need to be provided by the artists.
NART aspires to be an open institution in various ways and also opens up the residents’ work. Some residents are invited to give an online public lecture and a seminar for students of the Estonian Academy of Arts. Moreover, NART will have an open doors day once every residency period. On this day residents will show their work or open their working process to the public.
The available residency periods in 2023 are the following, yet it is possible to have other arrangements:
● 9 January – 26 February
● 9 January – 19 March
● 27 February – 30 April
● 1 May – 2 July
● 1 June – 31 July
● 3 July – 15 September
● 1 August – 31 September
● 1 November – 23 December
Please send a file in English with the required information here. It should also include a short bio and/or portfolio. The deadline for applications is set for 25 November 2022 at 23:59 (Estonian time).

Applicants to the artist residency programme are invited to explore the civic implications of art in relation to themes such as a sense of belonging and the environment. VFA aims to build a network of people and processes capable of interpreting the material and immaterial specificities of the place/region. The residency programme of Villa Filanda Antonini fosters a transdisciplinary dialogic approach. For this reason, the call is open to artists of all disciplines, curators, designers, researchers, writers and architects.
The 2023 Residents will be called upon to develop a site-specific project in the abandoned warehouse spaces in front of the Villa. With a view to its future reuse and architectural restoration, VFA asks participants to come up with actions, strategies and/or works with a view to re-appropriating the industrial space by attributing new meaning to it for the community as a whole.
VFA hosts a minimum of three Residents up to a maximum of six per year. The residency must take place over a period of a minimum of two weeks and a maximum of eight. Continuous presence in the Villa is a prerequisite. There are two residency periods: May-July 2023 and October-November 2023. Participants will receive a gross weekly stipend of €450 and free accommodation in the Villa. VFA bears the production costs of the works. Food and travel costs are borne by the Resident.
The building is equipped with two double bedrooms with a shared bathroom and one bedroom with a private bathroom. A large and well-equipped kitchen is available to Residents, as well as a laundry room. The Villa offers comfortable common areas for exchange and socialisation. In addition to the large atelier on the ground floor, Residents can choose a space in which to work. The ample size of the building and the large garden provide plenty of opportunity for privacy and reflection.
Participants who are not EU citizens are requested to obtain any necessary travel and permanence documentation in good time. For detailed information, please visit the website of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The application dossier must be submitted exclusively electronically through the APPLY NOW session on the VFA’s website.

In the case of works created in participation with others, your own contribution must be specified.
Motivational letter/statement (max. 600 words, 1 MB max pdf file).
Copy of valid ID document/passport both sides of the only or main project referent (1 MB max pdf/jpg file) .

The big cities of the world are a melting pot of human thought, activities and achievements. They are a place of meetings and crossroads where great opportunities for human, social, societal, architectural, urban, artistic and cultural achievements can be found.
Like those of Paris or the Mediterranean basin, they open doors to all foreigners from different horizons and to experiences of all kinds.
They are the place of the greatest professional or other opportunities and bring together all kinds of human enterprises, small or large. They thus attract the inhabitants of neighbouring or provincial regions and other countries, in search of an “elsewhere” full of promise.
These large cities are also ""city-of-refuge"" for intellectuals, artists, political opponents, and people from other countries or cities, fleeing conflicts, who are looking for certain security, and planning short or long stays there, in a peaceful and reassuring environment.
This artist residency asks participants to create works inspired by the city that evoke the ""urban fact"" or ""urban doing"" in their physical, plastic, material, spiritual, human, psychological, and social dimensions...
The works will be presented during exhibitions in Paris and Beirut, “world cities” par excellence.
The Artémed association offers an artist residency in Paris on the theme of world city(ies). The AiR is aimed at artists of Mediterranean nationality (except French) who practice is painting, drawing, illustration, photography, or installation.
They provide accommodation, a production workshop, a grant of €500, and exhibitions in Paris and Beirut, as well as advertising.
The stay lasts from 1 to 2 months in 2023 or 2024.
The application must include a maximum of 6 pages, including:
2 presentation pages including:
Page 1: Age, Address and contact details, Training, Background, Exhibitions, Professional or non-professional experience
Page 2: Project for Paris
Page 3 to 6: Illustrations (with or without comments)
A copy of the identity document from a Mediterranean country is sent separately.
Deadline for submission: December 23, 2022
Email and information: [email protected]
The projects will be studied by operators in France and Lebanon:
Ola Abdallah, Salwa Fathallah, Ricardo Mbarkho and Serge Seroff.

Artists and researchers investigate the nature of our presence in the world, push boundaries in knowledge and technology, and venture into the unexplored. The questions our researchers study naturally provide inspiration for artistic inquiry, which in turn can offer a fresh perspective on the scientific endeavour. Both disciplines require creativity, curiosity, and imagination, combined with scrutiny, technique and determination.
IRB is a Barcelona-based biomedical research centre that works to achieve a society free of diseases. Their mission is to carry out multidisciplinary research of excellence to offer pioneering solutions to unresolved medical needs in cancer and other diseases linked to ageing. Their research results reach patients through technology transfer, which is accomplished by establishing collaborations with the pharmaceutical industry and the main hospitals.
They are also committed to knowledge. To this end, we offer the best training in biomedical sciences to young researchers, students and visitors, and maintain an open dialogue with citizens through a range of scientific communication and outreach activities.
IRB Barcelona's Artist in Residency Programme aims to connect artists with an interest in interdisciplinary science with the wide range of research, scientists, data and infrastructure available at the Institute. It provides a unique opportunity for artists to immerse themselves in the IRB Barcelona community for a free exchange of ideas and to explore, learn, and form relationships with our scientists and stakeholders. The programme seeks to provide time and space for reflection and inspiration for artists and scientists alike.
They look for professional artists, with a genuine interest in science who wish to further their art by working alongside our scientists to gain insight and perspective into cutting-edge research in the biomedical sciences. Applications from artists from any discipline are welcome.
Proposals should be focused on a specific theme involving interactions with their researchers, which cover a wide range of disciplines within the life sciences
Outcome
The Artist in Residence will be expected to define the details (duration, specific topic of the project, researchers involved, etc.) of the residency with the IRB Barcelona Coordination Team at the beginning of the residency. Furthermore, the artist is expected to:
Provide a written proposal of the final idea of his/her artwork after 6 months of the start of the residency.
Coordinate and meet regularly with the IRB Barcelona Coordination Team.
Establish dialogue with scientists and researchers at IRB Barcelona, with the support and guidance of the IRB Barcelona Coordination Team.
Give a talk and/or workshop during the residency
The artist is expected to develop artwork resulting from the residency that will be exposed in a previously agreed exhibition space.
The developed artwork must be based entirely on the IRB Barcelona residency.
The developed artwork will be presented in a public exhibition within one year after the completion of the residency.
The artistic interpretation and representation of the materials provided by IRB
Barcelona and made by the artist belong to the artist. The artist will retain legal title and ownership of the artwork created with the materials.
In the event that the artist obtains benefits from the commercial exploitation of his/her artwork, IRB Barcelona will be entitled to receive a percentage of said benefits, to be agreed upon in writing.","","","<div class=""field field--name-field-body field--type-entity-reference-revisions field--label-hidden field__items""><div class=field__item> <div class=""paragraph paragraph--type--text paragraph--view-mode--full""><div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-paragraph-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item""><p>Art and scientific research have several things in common.

Comprising of a wide range of individual artists working collectively under the Medea Electronique name, the group shares a predisposition for innovation in the performing arts. Working in fields like music, video, design, painting, multimedia, robotics, interactive technology and media production, they allow the integration of their distinctive areas of research and practice to define a unique style in the realisation of their collective projects - these range from multimedia theatrical plays to experimental audio-visual shows, and from improvised noise music through to field recording and electroacoustic composition.
Since 2009 the artist collective Medea Electronique has organized annually an experimental artist residency, Koumaria, near Sparta in Greece, focusing on improvisation and new media practices. Avant-garde artists from all over the world, inspired by the Greek natural landscape, come together to create a multicultural and cross-media ‘dialogue’ culminating in a collective presentation in Athens at the end of the residency.
The goal of the residency is the creation of an educational experience for the participants that will inspire and exalt their future work. The cross-cultural dialogues that the residency engenders both create new artistic speculations and smelt older assumptions. Past residents have formed lasting friendships and new artistic partnerships. Medea Electronique, being an eclectic art collective, is interested in people from diverse cultural and artistic backgrounds.
The 2023 residency will be conjoined with the Medea “Trials”. Medea is always looking to expand its own creative practice, and those it collaborates with, beyond the forms of creative expertise found within the collective. That is to say, Medea is looking to expand the particular way it focuses on new media art, electronic and electro-acoustic music, and other digital forms of creative expression. And so, the first 12 days of Koumaria will be spent at the residency site described above, where members of Medea will work with the residents to produce 4 distinct works (with distinct groundings in particular art forms or combinations of art forms). You will then move to Athens for 5 days, where these four works will be presented/performed as four “trials”. These are trials in the following senses:
They involve Medea members collaborating with new artists for the first time (the residents). These collaborative works will engage Medea members in creative environments new to them, and to the collective as a whole.
These collaborative works may serve as the beginning of longer-term collaborations, including looking for ways to fund more expansive and new versions of the works in the trials.
These four “trials” will be presented/performed in Athens at Plyfa Factory, where there will also be a discussion with the audience afterwards (a distinct form of trial). They hope these trials will be but the beginning of longer-term collaborations, and new more expansive projects.
You will also present your works in Sellasia, prior to returning to Athens, there taking advantage of the distinct sites the village and its surroundings offer for presentation and performance. To get a sense of the historical range of Medea projects, they invite applicants to explore pasts Koumaria performances/projects.
Your application should include a statement of your interest in this year’s theme, and a sketch of a way you might want to explore it collaboratively with other artists across disciplines and media. It should foreground the way in which you view your creative practice as different from/complementary to/ an expansion upon/ adding to, the creative practice of Medea (based on your knowledge of Medea as found in our archive, link above). They are looking for artists excited by the idea of collaborative artistic creation, grounded in an improvisatory spirit and practice. In particular, please describe your creative practice, and how it both relates to and differs from, that of Medea Electronique, and outline the sort of collaborative work you wish to create.
To apply, send an email to [email protected]. Alternatively, send an email to [email protected]. In the email you are expected to include the following material:
A personal statement detailing why you wish to participate (which should address the 2023 residency theme)

A new building will open in 2024 in St. Pölten and is set to become a unique hub for international contemporary art, children, and artists. Geared toward children up to twelve years of age, the new venue will offer two exhibitions a year, a children’s biennial, and a variety of thematically interrelated workshops and projects. The quality, event-based character, and topicality of contemporary art productions by international artists have the capacity to set in motion both individual educational processes and socially relevant reflections. Fellows selected by an expert jury will examine the potentialities of contemporary art for and with young audiences.
The KinderKunstLabor is a learning institution. Experiences and insights from educational processes are applied to the realm of art education and curating in a certification centre developed specifically for this purpose in cooperation with a university network. This is achieved with the RiR through an examination of current discourses and practices that are focused on phenomenological approaches, spatial aspects in art production, curating and art education for and with children. Closely intertwined with this, fellows will conceive and implement qualitatively based research projects that accompany ongoing projects of the KinderKunstLabor.
The art system characterises contemporary art more as an accumulation of knowledge and symbolic capital than as a resource for educational processes or the person or group experiences of young audiences. Nevertheless, uncharacteristic perspectives can be gleaned from interactive and performative art education situations. Few studies have examined the extent to which more experimental education processes are capable of initiating new perspectives and insights in and with young audiences. Accordingly, the aim of the RiR program is to more closely integrate practice and theory. Sustainable accompanying research allows findings to flow into practice. The RiR program enables fellows to develop and carry out a research-based project in collaboration with the KinderKunstLabor team.
Activities include the analysis, archiving, and documentation of artistic projects and exhibitions; empirical-qualitative research, e.g., in connection with artistic-research approaches; conferences; online and print publications; workshops and certifications.
The fellowship offers researchers from the EU active in the fields of contemporary art, curating, and education the opportunity to live and work in St. Pölten for a period of nine months with possible extension. They invite researchers with different artistic and theoretical practices to apply. Artistic expertise or experience with aesthetic processes and in-depth knowledge of the art field are a prerequisite. A sound command of the German language is essential. The fellowship is also aimed at students pursuing a doctorate or PhD. Priority will be given to research proposals developed in relation to and in dialogue with the specific, on-the-ground realities of the location. Fellows will have access to institutional infrastructures and are expected to present their findings at an event at the end of their stay.
The location offers fellows access to site-specific resources during their stay, and they can play a role in shaping a new and unique art institution. There are also opportunities to present talks and teach courses at academies and universities in their network. The residency includes travel, accommodation, a stipend, and production costs. Further information is available on request.
The application must include the following:
Your contact information (name, address, email, phone number, website)
Letter of motivation outlining your reasons for applying (max. one page)
Short informative CV (max. one page)
Compilation of previous research and projects (max. ten MB)

The organisers are looking for artists in the field of sound art, video art, performance, theatre, installation, or dynamic land art for their 2024 edition. They are especially interested in art that takes and needs space, art that is mobile or makes the audience move. They also look forward to receiving proposals for sound- and video art that embraces the snowy landscape as an endless projection surface.
minus20degree provides outside space for art that is controversial, and provocative yet founded. minus20degree is completely independent and thus does not need to please or go easy on the audience.
All artworks need to be conceptualized and produced especially for minus20degree.
The theme “Plateau” provides the theoretical framework for minus20degree 2024. Your submission does not need to have a direct connection to the theme. Nevertheless, they are interested to read your thoughts on “Plateau”.
As a geological formation, plateaus are a part of the landscape they are dealing with as exhibition space; simultaneously, as an expression of social stagnation, the organisers think that ""Plateau"" might be a valid description of our times.
All sites will be outside and exposed to the elements. Temperatures might be as low as minus 20 degrees so you can expect snow, but it also can rain. Therefore, all artworks must be water and temperature resistant. The amount of snow cannot be predicted. Generally, there is 20-60 cm in the valley and up to 150 cm in the mountains.
Flachau is a village with a large variety of natural and manmade landscapes. It is a scenic village with about 2.700 inhabitants that can host over 10.000 tourists. Hotels, ski lifts and ski slopes are very present elements in the landscape as well as barely touched forests, fields, and mountain tops. The entire valley can potentially be used as a site for artistic interventions.
For the open call, it is not necessary to know the exact location already. Once a project is selected by the jury, the minus20degree team will help the artist(s) to find an ideal spot for the work in the requested landscape or will help to find an alternative setting.
minus20degree supports:
Artist fee € 1.000, -
Production budget: up to € 1600, -
Travel budget: up to €400, -
Up to 6 nights’ accommodation (arrangements for longer stays can be made)
Support from the team throughout m20d24
Professional documentation of the work
Extra funding is very welcome and will be supported by minus20degree.
Application is open to individuals, pairs, or groups at any stage of their career. Please submit one single pdf to [email protected] before the 31st of January 2023 that contains the following:
A short description of your artwork (max. 150 words)
A long description (max. 500 words) that clearly and concisely explains the project you wish to produce incl. a reflection on the theme “Plateau”.
Clear technical drawing and/or script of execution of the artwork (1 x A4)
Total production budget of the artwork (including build-up and removal of artwork)
CV with contact details including name, phone number and links (if existing). (1 x A4)
Please note:
Stability and security of artwork is the responsibility of the artist.
Ownership of artwork remains with the artist.
A special Q&A session will also be organised via Zoom on the 21st of December 2022 during which we will also share more information about Flachau as well as pictures of possible locations for your artworks. The exact time and link will be shared via their website.","","","<div class=""field field--name-field-body field--type-entity-reference-revisions field--label-hidden field__items""><div class=field__item> <div class=""paragraph paragraph--type--text paragraph--view-mode--full""><div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-paragraph-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item""><p>minus20degree is a biennial exhibition of art and architecture. minus20degree provides a stage for radical artistic interventions in the alpine winter landscape and makes them freely accessible to the public. minus20degree provides a laboratory, with snow as the primary resource for all expressions of art and architecture.</p><p>The organisers are looking for artists in the field of sound art, video art, performance, theatre, installation, or dynamic land art for their<a href=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d78a9b251f8de4a748ec2d8/t/63582b43af27cb471a03da35/1666722660273/minus20degree_OpenCall2024.pdf rel="" noopener"" target=_blank> 2024 edition</a>.

Back to Basics residency programme allows artists to clear their minds, get back to focus, and (re)discover the very basis of their being.
Take a break from your smartphone, reconnect with your creativity, be part of nature and learn to stay present again, doing only things you want to be doing.
As the emphasis in this programme is on reconnecting with your creative practice and being, no predetermined project plan is required. Participants are encouraged to arrive with their minds open for on-site observations, ideas, self-reflection and interacting with other artists. With support from the professional staff, facilities, and the program structure, Back to Basics allows you to go back to what matters to you.
The summer season is ideal for exploring and getting inspired by the rich Finnish nature surrounding Arteles Creative Center. There are countless forests, fields, lakes, and small countryside roads in the region. Thanks to Finland’s everyman’s rights, they can all be explored freely.
Midsummer is full of light: even in the middle of the night, it’s bright enough to go for a walk in the forest. Seasonal berries and mushrooms can be picked from the yard and the woods, and when it’s time to get relaxed, the residency center’s traditional wood-burning sauna is the place to be.
In order to maintain a focused environment, there is no wifi in this programme (excluding the first 1-2 days of settling in). Internet is available one day per week when it can be accessed with a USB connection. Residents can use their own or the house laptop. Note: In case of an important appointment/ work etc. commitment that cannot be rescheduled, temporary access can be arranged by consulting the staff in advance.
Residency periods for 2023 are:
2-30 May
1-29 June
3-31 July
2-30 August
There is no application fee.
Applicants who otherwise would be unable to join the programme can apply for financial support. The number of financially supported residencies is limited.
Regular fee: 1950 € / month
Financially supported fee: 1270 € / month
Contributor's fee: 2610 € / month
All fees include the registration fee (120 € / person, non-refundable, to be paid only if/when becoming selected). All the residents have accommodation in a private bedroom.
They are welcoming emerging and professional artists, writers and creatives from diverse fields and backgrounds. In the selection process, an emphasis is put on the applicant’s approach, alignment and suitability to the program theme. They value authenticity and tenacity.
They do not require a project proposal in the application as this would be in contradiction with the programme. Also, they understand that when working in the creative field, your subjects, interests and working methods tend to change and evolve along the way.
You can apply online with this webform.
Requirements & notes:
You must be at least 23 or older to apply (in 2023)
Only individual applicants may apply (to apply as a duo, please send two individual applications and mention it in the ""extra notes""-field of the application)

The residencies, for a total duration of four weeks, and any fieldwork missions shall take place between March 2023 and November 2023 (except over the summer period, i.e. July and August).
Artist and researcher duos apply with a predefined project. The work produced by means of this collaboration is intended to be multidisciplinary, and it should emphasise the articulation of social sciences with the issues of innovative and creative narratives.
The laureates are thus offered the opportunity to involve themselves in Campus Condorcet project, an intellectual and artistic hub located only fifteen minutes by metro from Paris city centre, and partake in the new dynamic of the urban and cultural development of the Paris Metropolis.
The residency grants include:
For artists: transportation fees, accommodation at the Maison des Chercheurs of Campus Condorcet and a flat-rate mobility allowance equivalent to one month’s stay as part of the Visiting Professorship programme (between 3700 and 4000 euros for a 28-day period).
For researchers: coverage of mission expenses for a maximum of a one-month fieldwork, as well as compensation of the expenses related to accommodation in case researchers reside outside the Ile-de-France region (transportation if necessary, per diem).
If the selected projects involve fieldwork, CRESS will cover the costs of the artists’ and researchers’ fieldworks for a period up to a month.
A budget intended to cover the practical needs generated by the project (space rentals, material, equipment, etc.) may be allocated. An estimate of these additional costs should be provided.
Eligibility conditions
Researchers are to belong to one of the EHESS research centres: full member researchers, postdoctoral fellows (contractors with EHESS at the time of application as well as during the residency), EHESS doctoral candidates (whether contractors or not).
Artists and researchers are to collaborate in order to create an original work or a new project. To be eligible, artists are to reside outside the French territory.
Projects that consolidate links with EHESS partners or develop links with new cultural institutions based in the Ile-de-France region for production and/or exhibition will be valued.
Collaborations are to result in exhibitions, in a form to be determined, at the end of residencies.
This common production will have to be within the financial and technical resources of EHESS. It is reminded to the project leaders that the institution does not have the production resources of an artistic institution
Application guidelines
The application should include
general information about the applicants (CVs of the researcher and the artist, examples of previous works);
the project application, including a summary of the project and its detailed description (2,000 words max.);
a detailed budget estimate for the project implementation (production costs, events, etc.). Budgetary, technical and logistical expertise will be mobilised to assess the project and its feasibility;
a technical sheet for creation and restitution stages of the project;
any additional information on the project (themes, approaches, disciplines, etc.) as well as on the cultural institutions proposed for the production/exhibition of the project and on the spaces to be invested on Campus Condorcet. A review committee composed of EHESS researchers, artists and members of cultural institutions will be in charge of selecting the projects.

Designed above all for artists, this place provides them with spaces, tools, and professional support to create a working environment that encourages exchange between different artforms and the expansion of their practice. With production workshops for construction, ceramics, 3D printing, engraving, silk screen, photography, video, and graphics, the Fondation Fiminco residency is a genuine hub of contemporary creation.
The aim of the Foundation is not to build up and display a collection, but to support the residents throughout their creative process, accompanying their professional and artistic development. By relying on the multidisciplinary nature of art forms and research, the Fondation Fiminco also intends to create connections between different art scenes and offer curators in residence the opportunity to situate their work in other creative contexts.
The Fondation Fiminco is launching an open call for international curators for a 3-month curatorial residency based in Romainville (Seine-Saint-Denis). Two residency periods are on offer: mid-January to mid-April 2023 and mid-April to mid-July 2023.
The residency programme is open to curators living in France and abroad, with no age limit, who can demonstrate an emerging or established professional career. This call is part of the dynamic of the Fondation Fiminco’s artist residency programme, which hosts 12 international artists concurrently for 11 months, from September 2022 to July 2023, as well as one-off residency programmes in collaboration with institutional partners around the world.
The primary objective of the residency is to prove the curators with the ideal setting for their research and creative work. A furnished individual studio equipped with an internet connection will be made available. They will also have access to kitchens and communal living spaces, as well as conditions facilitating collaboration with other residents and with external organizations. The Fondation Fiminco’s residency is intended to be a place of professionalization that helps artists and curators gain visibility in the French art scene and become part of a network. The curators will be accompanied by the Foundation’s team throughout the residency.
In addition to their own research project, candidates must be involved in the Fondation Fiminco’s cultural programme and propose ideas based on two key events: The organization of an Open Studio with the artists in residence (February or May, depending on the chosen residency period), allowing the public to discover, over an entire day, the workshops and creative spaces of the artists and the curator in residence.
The organization of another event (such as a conference, portfolio review, performance, meetings with professionals from the art world, etc.). The research should take into account the links with the proposed research project and the artistic environment of the residents of the Fondation Fiminco. The proposed project may also develop links with other international art scenes.
These events will be organized and approved in close consultation with the Foundation’s team (context, budget, production, communication, and mediation). Candidates undertake to design and write one or more presentation texts and to be present at both events.
Support:
Resident curators will have a furnished studio with a private bathroom (between 20 and 25m2), a shared kitchen, and common living areas.
In order to support the research projects of the curators in residence, a research grant of a total amount of 5,000 euros (including VAT) will be awarded for the duration of the residency.

Designed above all for artists, this place provides them with spaces, tools, and professional support to create a working environment that encourages exchange between different artforms and the expansion of their practice. With production workshops for construction, ceramics, 3D printing, engraving, silk screen, photography, video, and graphics, the Fondation Fiminco residency is a genuine hub of contemporary creation.</p><p>The aim of the Foundation is not to build up and display a collection, but to support the residents throughout their creative process, accompanying their professional and artistic development.

A furnished individual studio equipped with an internet connection will be made available. They will also have access to kitchens and communal living spaces, as well as conditions facilitating collaboration with other residents and with external organizations. The Fondation Fiminco’s residency is intended to be a place of professionalization that helps artists and curators gain visibility in the French art scene and become part of a network. The curators will be accompanied by the Foundation’s team throughout the residency.</p><ul><li>In addition to their own research project, candidates must be involved in the Fondation Fiminco’s cultural programme and propose ideas based on two key events: The organization of an Open Studio with the artists in residence (February or May, depending on the chosen residency period), allowing the public to discover, over an entire day, the workshops and creative spaces of the artists and the curator in residence.</li><li>The organization of another event (such as a conference, portfolio review, performance, meetings with professionals from the art world, etc.). The research should take into account the links with the proposed research project and the artistic environment of the residents of the Fondation Fiminco. The proposed project may also develop links with other international art scenes.</li></ul><p>These events will be organized and approved in close consultation with the Foundation’s team (context, budget, production, communication, and mediation).

There are many ways to navigate this. The organisers suggest beginning by emphasizing the collective nature of this year’s residency. By involving creative individuals that are willing to co-create the residency with them, hybrida.space aims to work with the following question:
""How can we, as a group, set collective goals and self-organize in ways that prioritize both individual creativity and communality?""
The entire group of residents will shape the residency programme together, starting with a few preparatory meetings online in which the parameters will be set for the period residents and organisers will be spending together in Sweden, focusing on these aspects:
Production of individual art projects
Organisation of a communal household
Co-defining the curatorial framework and envisioning the final exhibition
During these meetings, decisions are made together which will inform the structure of the residency. Residents will live and work on location for 8 weeks, and work towards a final exhibition that will be open to the public for 2 weeks.
They have eight open spots for the residency period for 2023:
Four of them are reserved for artists from the following Nordic countries: Denmark, Finland, the Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Åland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. International artists residing in these countries are also eligible. The remaining four places are for artists from any country, including Sweden.
The residency period is taking place from the 22nd of May and lasts until the 23rd of July. It also includes a few online meetings before the official start in May. The dates may be subject to change.
The location of the residency is special and far away from the contemporary art world —not only measured by kilometers. They are curious how the applicants think they could benefit from working in a group, as well as in a remote setting. What do they believe the location could offer, and what effect could it have on their work?
During the 2022 residency, they experimented with setting up a public programme comprised of artist talks, lectures, and workshops that were open to the public and some being streamed online. This approach can be generous since it opens up for exchange within the group, and at the same time provides a larger audience and the local inhabitants of the village the opportunity to get insights into everyone’s practices. That way they can contribute to integrating the works, practices, and the residency program into the local context, and they are interested in collaborating with artists who can think along these lines as well.
During the selection process, the organisers are focusing on these following:
Portfolio
Project description
Thoughts on how you can benefit from working in this location and within the residency format
Thoughts on how to contribute to the self-organized nature of the residency. How you can have an active role in forming the residency period, in curatorial, artistic, and practical ways?
They are looking for applicants that have graduated from higher studies in visual arts or equivalent fields, or alternatively, have a professional art practice for more than 3 years, and who are available 90-100% of the time between May 15 to July 15 (exact dates might change).
Send your application as one PDF file through the application form. The application should contain the following, in the same order as listed below:
Motivation for joining this year's residency, maximum 250 words
Contribution to the self-organised format, maximum 250 words
Project description, maximum 250 words. (If it’s a complex project in terms of making/building, please attach a separate budget calculation and a detailed project plan)

This institutional focus aims at creating a common ground that embraces a diversity of practices and allows for a multitude of voices.
As a post-academic institute, the Jan van Eyck Academie supports this myriad of artistic endeavours by offering participants the time, space, and expertise to further develop, materialise, and disseminate their artistic research in a critical and reciprocal relationship with each other and the world.
The academy provides each selected participant with a private studio, guidance of our advisers, access to our library and labs – Photography & Audiovisual, Material Matters, Food, Printing & Publishing, and Future Materials; expertise of departments for Nature Research, Art & Society and Research & Education. Next to their individual projects, participants are encouraged to collaboratively develop an In-Lab project and to contribute to the Jan van Eyck public programme.
As a multi-disciplinary post-academic institute, the Jan van Eyck Academie in Maastricht, the Netherlands, offers residency programmes to those who wish to broaden their artistic horizons, develop their art practice in-depth, and discover new perspectives. Every applicant shares our belief that insight comes through exchange with the other: insight in the meaning of things, in your own practice, in the (art) world. The multiform character of the Jan van Eyck Academie appeals to the artistic and intellectual versatility of the artists and enables them to deepen and ramify their talents and skills in the short and long run. The work of the artists testifies to an art practice that is investigative and committed. Furthermore, the Jan van Eyck encourages exploration of the agency, roles, and civic significance of art, design and other creative practices in relation to climate change, environmental breakdown, and their manifold effects.

At its centre lies contemporary art, boundary-crossing research, practical experimentation, communication, education and events, all reaching towards a post-fossil culture by combining scientific knowledge and experiential artistic activity. Since its foundation, Mustarinda Association has been committed to strengthening the cultural and practical prerequisites for the ecological transition. In the coming years, the Mustarinda Association seeks to actively challenge conventions of research, production, and dissemination, focusing on the social conditions of post-fossil life and the long term possible futures in ecological reconstruction.
Tangled through the house, the sauna, the garden, the yard, the forest, its mires and wetlands, the more-than-human and the human bodies work towards the ecological rebuilding of society, the diversity of cultures and natures, and the connection between art and science.
Mustarinda welcomes you to think along with them during your residency and beyond. However, this is not a brief for a thematic residency and your individual or collective practice is valued in its own right. The open call is for wherever your research, process, focus, or need for time and space takes you.
The residency is for a diverse field of practices from artist to educator, researcher, activist or other practitioners.
Working periods:
Spring:
2 weeks from January 16.1. - 30.1.2023
1 month period in February - May
Autumn:
1 month period in September - November.

Extra person/working pair in same bedroom +150e/month.
The selection process:
Residency selections are made by a group of Mustarinda Association members that changes yearly. They are mainly operating on a voluntary basis and are therefore currently unable to give individual feedback on applications.
They aim to select applicants from all stages of their practice who they believe would benefit from the Mustarinda house, its environment, and their fellow residents. They intend to bring together practices that can support each other, but that also allow discussions and interactions between different cultural, educational, and economic backgrounds, identities, and ways of thinking.
The selection process is guided by:
Contents of the application
How the application communicates with other applications
Availability: applicants' wish on working period
The composition of each residency month’s selected group

They believe that the climate emergency is caused by industrialized societies having forgotten that Planet Earth is not just ‘resources’ for humans to utilize and grab. Collaborations across science and art can propose new ways to understand other species and the more-than-human with whom we share this planet.
Earthwise Residency focuses on research and practices, which heightens our sensitivity, knowledge, and methods for consciously reweaving our human lives with the myriad of relations and interdependencies we all rely on. We are interested in communication with the living world and the animal kingdom, and in developing creative work that situates and enhances curiosity, intimacy, and encounters with the more-than-human, while at the same time exploring corresponding academic research through artistic lenses. The two residencies Curious Encounters is an active contribution to the paradigm shifts occurring right now. They believe that interdisciplinary meetings – the meeting and mixing of aesthetics, humanities, and sciences – hold the possibility to foster new thoughts, and rediscover ancient knowledge as well as new paths for action.
Each residency is for two collaborating working partners: One artist and one researcher / specialist. The interdisciplinary collaboration between artist and researcher should aim to address the theme of multispecies relations and the more-than-human. The residencies will take place at Earthwise Residency, Mols, Denmark.
They are looking for performing artists and visual artists with an interest in time-based work and performance who (preferably) already have contact or ongoing collaboration with a researcher. However, they also encourage artists or researchers, who are looking for a collaborator to apply, as they may curate teams by paring up persons. Therefore, they also encourage scientific researchers to apply, and they may pair you up. Applicants must have a genuine interest in interdisciplinary approaches, and preferably some experience of working with the-more-than-human.
The researcher/specialist should be actively engaged in research processes and hold a master’s degree, preferably a Ph.D. degree. The researcher/specialist may have a background in the Humanities, Social Sciences or STS.
The artist must pursue the theme of more-than-human through primarily visual or performing arts. They encourage both emerging/upcoming artists as well as mid-career artists to apply.
Age is of no importance. If you are unsure whether you meet the criteria for the residency or have further queries or questions, please email them.
Residency periods:
The first residency will take place from January 9th – February 19th, 2023.
The second residency will take place from appr. April 17th – May 29th, 2023 (dates can be negotiated).
Earthwise provides:
Working space (writing tables, as well as a small studio space, and lots of outdoor space)
Accommodation in private rooms in a house shared with Earthwise volunteers
Space for partners/children can be negotiated
Access to a rich library w/ relevant titles
Access to the other facilities of Earthwise
Dialogue and conversations with Earthwise’s host, and possibly other respondents
A stipend of 1.800 € for each of the two persons
A small budget for materials.
They do not cover travel (international nor domestic), but can provide information on possible funding options, as well as make an official invitation to ease your travels across borders. Earthwise has a consequent and friendly approach to sustainable choices, including travelling and can advise travel options with a smaller CO2-footprint. Should air travel be unavoidable They encourage you to support a trustworthy tree planting project.
During each residency period, the two residents are asked to:
Hold 1-2 dissemination events or ‘artist/researcher talks’ for the local community.
Participate in their next Earthbound Symposium in 2023.
You may be invited to do other presentations within our network, perhaps online.
Earthwise will make a detailed contract with the residents.
If you are interested, please send them a joint application including:
A short biography from both artist and researcher (max 500 characters each)
A text about why you are interested in the residency, what you would work on and how your work relates to the focus of Curious Encounters; the more-than-human, etc. (max 2400 characters/1 page)
If you are an artist looking for a scientific collaborator, you are more than welcome to send an independent application, and they may be able to pair you with a fitting collaborator. Your application should also contain your biography.
If you are a scientific researcher / specialist, the same is valid as stated above.
If you are applying as an artist-researcher collaboration, please also write a part of the one-page together about your preliminary plans for the residency period.
* Please state whether you are an emerging or mid-career artist.
** Please state which residency period you can attend (if both are possible, let themknow)

The family has lived here since around the year 1500 and they love to share the Mediterranean lifestyle with people from all over the world. Arts and culture got them through the pandemic so they decided to start an art residency to celebrate art and artists. This residency is supported thanks to their guests, individuals and companies, who book stays and retreats at Mas Palou.
They want to invite up to 7 artists from around the world to spend 9 days at their estate and work on their crafts. Absolutely any artistic discipline is welcome. Expect to meet amazing people from all over the world, have dialogue, have time to create and think, food, and wine. Expect to become part of Mas Palou and to meet locals who will blow your mind. Exciting things will happen. You can check some of the highlights on Instagram to get a sense of what the last residencies were like.
In return, Mas Palou gets your delightful company and an art contribution from you (be it a physical piece, a concert, a performance, etc). You can tell them more about it in your proposal. There will be a final event with the press and guests where everyone will share their work.
The stay is free except for the food, and travel to and from Mas Palou. It includes accommodation in a room for yourself (or your art collective if it’s more than one person) in a beautiful villa you’ll share with other artists, with access to a kitchen and to plenty of space to work. You won’t be sharing a room with any strangers. Bathrooms are shared. There will be a couple of meals included but otherwise, you can cook your own food in the kitchen or go to a local restaurant.
The villa has access to high-speed wi-fi as well as a fully-equipped kitchen and on-site laundry facilities. Mas Palou does not provide personal laptops or electronic devices, or art materials. There will be some scheduled trips to the grocery store as well as some field trips to local museums and/or wineries. Additional details will be provided upon acceptance to the program.

The artists-in-residence at Zaratan are given the opportunity to develop a project over a fixed period of time, and to reflect and consolidate their artistic practice in the specific context of Lisbon.
They provide private accommodation, 24/7 private working studio, technical assistance, promotion and communication support, and open public presentation of the residency process.

​At NSF they see ‘re-start’ and ‘re-adapt’ as definitions concerned with how artists approach creating artwork for a post-Covid reality. Some of the questions posed are: how might artists address these terms, how might we adapt to this new reality we find ourselves in, how might we work across different disciplines and how do we adapt artworks to become more inclusive entities using new technology? iM KONSTHALL avoids geographical boundaries by bringing the gallery to the audience.
The organisers are interested to hear how the two main themes might be interpreted by each artist, how this might provoke and inspire new work and encourage new ways for the public to engage with immersive technologies. They are prioritising artists experienced in digital technologies. iM Konsthall is a long-term project so they are keen to hear from artists moving into this sphere that might have something innovative and new to offer for future possibilities.
Applications are evaluated by selected professionals in the fields of digital technologies.

The duration of residency is 4 months: INHABIT #9: March–June 2023 and INHABIT #10: September–December 2023.
Who are they looking for:
Artists from different disciplines (with a focus on time-based and performing arts, installation and music) who are interested in interdisciplinary collaboration between the artistic and scientific fields;

This six-week residency from October 15 - November 25 is an incredible opportunity for an artist whose practice would benefit from observing the workings of a busy satellite groundstation campus before immersing themselves in the creative environment of The Residency at Greywood Arts.
The award includes an opportunity for the selected artist to showcase their research and creative process, and to experiment with installation of work from the residency at the National Space Centre, located near Midleton, Co. Cork.
The residency organisers seek imaginative proposals investigating big ideas on how we can conceive of the infinite possibilities the universe has to offer, or what our actions in outer space tell us about our relationship to Earth and to each other. From philosophy to science fiction, the complex themes that emerge might include space exploration and colonisation, space tourism, the regulation and control of outer space, satellite technology, space debris, radio and light pollution, climate change, planetary origins, asteroids, and the possibility of life in outer space.
Early career, women-identified, and minority artists are especially encouraged to apply. This award is named for Agnes Mary Clerke (1842-1907), an Irish astronomer and writer from County Cork, Ireland. Through her quarter-century career, she became a leading commentator on astronomy and astrophysics in the English-speaking world. She was the author of Modern Cosmogonies, whose chapter “The Inevitable Ether” inspired the title of this award.
The award includes:
Access to the National Space Centre campus at Elfordstown Earthstation, Midleton Cork, Ireland.
Accommodation and studio space at The Residency at Greywood Arts, Killeagh, Cork, Ireland.
Transportation between Greywood Arts & the NSC
€2,000 Stipend to be used for travel, per diem and materials at the discretion of the artist.
The artist will:
Have access to the National Space Centre’s Elfordstown Earth Station for 5 working days (3 days in week 1, plus two additional visits in weeks 2-4).
Engage with Earth Station staff, including the Chief Technical Officer and Operations Manager, at pre-scheduled times.
Have the opportunity to share their creative process and experiment with installation of work from the residency at the National Space Centre, which will open to the public November 18-20th. This opportunity to interface with the public will be showcased alongside an exhibition from our STEAM education programme.
Participate in a public conversation about their research, practice and residency experience at the showcase launch at the NSC.
Receive access to satellite imagery, data from the European Space Agency, NASA and the James Webb Telescope.
Receive access to audio data from the Big Dish archive and Blackrock Observatory.
Get feedback and curatorial support from Greywood Arts.
Receive support in engaging with the community, if applicable.
Have the opportunity to select a book for, and participate in, Greywood’s Meaningful Conversations Book Club session on November 22nd.
Applications from pairs of collaborators will be considered, but they must be willing to share a bedroom. Artists must be fully vaccinated to access the NSC campus.
Residency dates: October 15th – November 25th, 2022
Showcase dates: November 18-20 at the National Space Centre
Application
Applications are done via an online form until the deadline on August 19, 2022.
Applications should include

Granada UNESCO City of Literature and the University of Granada will provide the writers in residence with opportunities to participate in the city’s literary life, arranging contacts with local writers, involvement in workshops, teaching activities, and so on.
The writers in residence will undertake to participate in public activities related to the local literary system, as proposed by the programme’s organisers, as well as will devote the time of the residency to carry out their literary project, and agree not to get involved in other public activities with other institutions or in other cities without prior notification to those responsible for the Programme.

Residents will be active professionals in their respective fields and will encourage the growth and development of the UAFS curriculum. Applications are currently being accepted for the Spring 2023 semester.
This program seeks to enrich the student experience, breadth of knowledge, and connection to creative communities while providing meaningful support for our residents’ creative practice. Additionally, residents will have access to and can participate in developing interdisciplinary initiatives and interdepartmental programs across the UAFS campus.

Exhibitions, lectures, archival investigations and publications have served as outputs of research, but more importantly as active platforms for its development. Initiated by former Head of Research Marina Otero Verzier, Het Nieuwe Instituut’s Fellowship Programme has a fundamental role in these platforms. Intended as a means of supporting and learning from a variety of research initiatives and methodologies, the fellowship is ultimately an opportunity to rehearse other modes of thinking and doing. The Research department proposes Testing Grounds as the focus for the 2022 open call.
In line with the fellowship programme’s ongoing ambition to rehearse other modes of thinking and doing, the focus of this year’s call for fellows is on supporting research practices as testing grounds. Approaching these testing grounds as action spaces and networks of relations allows us to find research causes, try out methodologies and develop tools. This year’s theme does not focus on ‘testing grounds’ as the content of research only, but as ways of doing research.
Grounds are often seen as stable entities, but they can also be malleable and muddy – mobile ecologies of being. Although grounds are imagined as holding bodies, feeding them and ‘grounding’ them, they do not do this equally. Grounds have been a space for inequality for both human and more-than-human life. How can we rehabilitate those grounds? Where does the potential lie to nurture and heal them? Within this open call, ‘grounds’ become metaphors for ‘issue spaces’, communities for grounding or belonging, and the grounds of debate.
Aside from the field or ‘ground’ to test ideas, speaking to innovation and laboratory narratives, testing grounds also connote military or colonial enterprises, in which ‘the ground’ and ‘the abroad’ are seen as sites for probing oppressive models of being. How can we reimagine the testing ground as a non-extractive, anti-colonial, intersectional, more-than-human, feminist ground for doing otherwise? Testing grounds not for exclusionary and sanitised research, but for collective actions that provide foundations for rehearsing radically healing models of co-creation that include all life.
Through this open call, Het Nieuwe Instituut offers a space for such testing grounds and sites for action-based forms of research: investigating new materials, exploring other ways of working and collaborating, initiating alternative policy models, regenerating new institutions, retooling archives and forms of heritage, while moving our attention to the messy methodologies and dynamic processes that occur while making change happen.
The testing grounds the open call refers to can go beyond the institutional and fellowship grounds of Het Nieuwe Instituut. This open call also asks for the consideration of other sites, forms of collaboration, ecologies, cosmologies and cosmograms.
About the Research Fellowships
Het Nieuwe Instituut offers two Research Fellowship positions for six months (from October 2022 to March 2023). Each of these positions includes a maximum budget of 20,000 euros. Stipends may be subject to a withholding tax.
There is no age limit for applicants. Individuals and collectives from all places of residence are invited to apply. Neither a curriculum vitae nor letters of recommendation are requested. The fellowships are open to all degree levels in all disciplines (design, architecture and digital culture). Equal priority will be given to those without a degree or institutional affiliation who can also demonstrate a high level of creativity, critical thought and other potential in their respective fields.
Fellows have daily access to the facilities of Het Nieuwe Instituut, including the library, archives, exhibitions, workspaces and presentation spaces. Other resources may be available in concert with other departments of Het Nieuwe Instituut as well as its ongoing institutional partnerships.

As a part of the UArts community, these artists-in-residence will have access to the faculty, staff, students, workshops and programming of a thriving arts institution located on the Avenue of Arts in the heart of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
The Inspiration Lab Artist-in-Residence at University of the Arts (ILab@UArts) will accelerate and cultivate contributions to contemporary knowledge production within the arts by providing devoted studio space, time, resources and access to key facilities and expertise for emerging and mid-career artists working across disciplines.
Artists are invited to apply for residencies of a minimum of three months to a maximum of 12 months. Each artist will be afforded a private and professional studio ranging in size from approximately 500 to 1000 square feet.
The Inspiration Lab studios are located on the Avenue of the Arts in the heart of Philadelphia, in UArts’ Anderson Hall, an eight-story building devoted to the visual arts, design and museum studies.
The Inspiration Lab houses 10 individual studios, two central gallery/installation spaces and one communal lounge.

Located around an hour from Tokyo, a residency at ARCUS Studio allows participants in the program to come into contact with the contemporary art scene in Japan as well as devote themselves to their creative endeavors in a calm environment while interacting with the local community. Through the support the program offers from its dedicated team of coordinators and regular tutorials with a curator, artists are able to search for and explore approaches in their practices and undertake new challenges in their artistic expression.
The program particularly emphasizes research-based practices and presents the initial results of these processes at open studios. It welcomes ideas for artworks and projects that develop out of encounters with people, the land, and culture, and aspire to form critical spaces that are open and international.
The residency takes place between 30 August - 7 December 2022 for the total of 100 days.

It offers professional artists from all fields of art the opportunity to free themselves from their everyday routines for the duration of their residency and focus on creative work.
Residence participants are encouraged to delve into their artistic work and to develop potential new directions for it side by side with the other residents. Saari Residence also gives artists a platform to meet other artists and share their thoughts and ideas.
The residence’s long-term activities and thinking are underpinned by an ecological approach, which also covers social and mental sustainability. The keywords are slowness, insight and change. When selecting artists for the residence, whether they work with ecological topics is not one of our selection criteria; instead, our focus on ecology lies in the residence’s overall activities. Those who are coming to the residence from outside Finland are encouraged to apply for a grant for slow travel to cover their travel expenses. The slow travel grant must be applied for at the same time as the general residency grant; you cannot apply for it retrospectively.
The residencies are designed for artistic work. Priority is given to multidisciplinary, new, or non-mainstream themes and fields of art.
The common language of the international artist in residence is English.
Application
The deadline for applications is on 31 March 2022. Only applications submitted via the online grant service during the application period will be considered.
Applications for residencies are always submitted a year before the residency takes place. The two-month working periods for individuals take place from January to February 2023, from March to April 2023, from September to October 2023 and from November to December 2023. From June to mid-August, all the facilities of the residence are reserved for the residency periods of groups of artists, ranging from 2 to 4 weeks.
Applications for the artist residencies are submitted in Kone Foundation’s online service for grants. Please note that applications by email or other means outside the online service are not accepted. Please read the application instructions carefully before compiling yours.
Saari Residence offers artists:
A grant: An individual residency spanning two months includes accommodation, a workroom and a monthly grant, which is determined according to the applicant’s experience (€2,500 / €3,000 / €3,600 per month). The grant is intended to cover the cost of living, travel costs and other expenses. Groups can apply for a grant for the duration of their residency (2 to 4 weeks).
Grant for slow travel: Residents are encouraged to opt for slow travel. Slow travel means avoiding flying and other ecologically unsustainable means of transport. If the journey takes more than a week in total, it is possible to also apply for a work grant for the period of travelling.
Accommodation: The Saari Residence apartments have a kitchen or kitchenette with basic amenities, and one of the buildings has a shared kitchen. Each resident has a whole apartment to themselves, and each apartment has an en suite shower and toilet. Groups live more closely and often share apartments.
Working space: The Saari Residence’s barn has been renovated as a diverse workspace for artists engaged in different art forms. The barn contains a dance studio, four studios for visual artists, a small sewing corner and a woodworking shop. The rooms for those engaged in writing are located in the apartments. The residence does not have a darkroom, media room or equipment for printing, nor equipment for pottery, graphic art or textile work (apart from a sewing machine). You can also apply for a residency for the planning phase of your work. Groups working at the residence during summer months may also work in the unheated outbuildings. You will not have to share your workspace with others.
Peaceful working environment: Saari Residence is located in a tranquil rural setting surrounded by nature, on the shore of Mietoistenlahti, 30 km north of Turku. Its diverse workspaces, the nearby waterfowl habitat and the peaceful rural surroundings provide a productive setting for focusing on your work. Saari Residence is not aimed, for example, at networking within the field of art or putting on exhibitions or performances, and no exhibition or performance is required at the end of the residency period.
Opportunity to meet other artists: The residence is a place for the artists and researchers working there to meet, share and leave their mark on each others’ thoughts and work and the Saari Residence itself. During the spring and autumn, the Saari Residence provides individual residencies usually for eight artists at a time for a period of two months. During the individual residencies, there is also one researcher or non-fiction writer working at Saari with the help of a grant from Kone Foundation. In addition, the Saari Residence community artist works at the residence throughout the year.
Mentoring programme: Each artist working in an individual residency is offered the opportunity for two mentoring meetings with remote access during their residency. The mentors are key professionals in their fields of art who live in Finland. They have a career spanning at least a couple of decades and are skilled listeners and conversationalists. They all also have a personal relationship with the Saari Residence. The mentoring sessions will be carried out in connection with the two-month periods of individual residencies, from the beginning of September to the end of April. There is no mentoring in the summer.
Who can apply?
Saari Residence is an international retreat available to individual professional artists, authors, translators, curators and critics, as well as groups of artists (working groups or organisations with a business ID and at least three members in the group) from Finland and abroad, where the residents selected carry out a pre-established work plan during their residency. Work partners must apply for an individual residency by filling in a joint application. Researchers or non-fiction writers cannot apply for residency through an open application.
The Saari Residence strives to take equality and accessibility into account in its operations. You can also apply to the Saari Residence with your family. As part of the Saari Residence’s social sustainability, accessibility and diversity, workgroups arriving from Global South can apply for support for the flights.
Possibility of a home residency
If the applicant is unable to travel to the Saari Residence due to accessibility reasons, they can apply to the Saari Residence’s home residency programme. Home residencies are granted only if there are good grounds for doing so. The reasons for granting a home residency relate to accessibility and equality, such as physical limitations, family reasons (e.g. being a single parent) or the difficult political situation of the applicant’s country of origin. A person working in a home residency participates in the activities remotely. The home residency is comparable to working at the residence, and applicants can apply either to work at the Saari Residence in person or at home within the Saari Residence’s home residency programme.

Developed as a means to support emerging visual artists, sound artists, musicians, performers, writers, and curators, the program provides artists with the opportunity to expand upon their individual practices as well as take part in optional programming within a collaborative community. This summer ACRE will continue with a restructured model focusing on smaller residencies with a reduced number of people on campus. Up-to-date vaccinations and a negative test before traveling are required for all visitors. For more information please see ACRE's On-Site Agreements which outline their protocols for staying at the farm in light of the ongoing pandemic.
Set on 1,000 acres of wetland, hills, and farmland, the residency facilities include expansive communal workspaces, a screen-printing studio, woodshop, ceramics studio, fibers studio, art & tech facility, and a sound studio. Two meals per day plus a light breakfast are provided and prepared daily using ingredients grown in the surrounding area.
Over the subsequent year, ACRE endeavors to provide further opportunities for exposure and community building to its alumni. Each resident is offered an exhibition opportunity at our Chicago gallery or one of a number of alternative exhibition spaces we partner within Chicago and is given access to an online “flat file,” where they can develop customizable pages to present their work. These efforts complement other activities and programming designed to create the conditions for a thriving and enduring arts network.

The Core Program offers a unique opportunity for these practitioners to engage with emerging artists in an intensive peer group. Core artists and critical studies fellows participate in a yearlong seminar, the content of which is driven by contemporary concerns, the interests and work of the fellows, and the Core lecture series and visitors. Critical studies fellows may apply for support for a curatorial project in their second year.
During the Core term, distinguished artists, critics, curators, and scholars are invited to meet individually with the residents, lead seminars, and deliver public lectures. Past and upcoming visitors include Charles Gaines, Krista Thompson, Martha Rosler, Kaja Silverman, Stan Douglas, Fred Moten, Emily Jacir, Darby English, Lauren Berlant, Helen Molesworth, David Hartt, Gerard Byrne, Naeem Mohaiemen, Huey Copeland, Sharon Hayes, Hamza Walker, Lawrence Abu Hamdan, and Tania Bruguera.
The residency term is nine months, from September to May, and fellows may apply for a second term. Each spring the program mounts an exhibition of work produced by the artists during the residency, which is accompanied by a publication to which the critical studies residents contribute texts based on their original research. Residents receive a 20,000 USD stipend, 24-hour access to a private studio or office, and borrowing privileges at the Museum’s Hirsch Library and Rice University’s Fondren Library. Because the program is intended to foster intensive participation in an active peer group, including regular seminar meetings, Core fellows must reside in Houston for the duration of the Core term.
Limited administrative and financial support is available for successful international applicants seeking J-1 visas through the program’s partner organization, International Arts & Artists. No support is provided for obtaining other visas.
How to apply
Applications for the 2022–23 Core term are due 1 April 2022. All application materials must be submitted online though SlideRoom. There is an application fee of $12.

It supports visual artists from all over the world by awarding artists-in-residence fellowships.
The Künstlerhaus is publicly presented through lectures, concerts and exhibitions. Works by the fellows are regularly shown in ‘Made in Balmoral’, the Künstlerhaus’s exhibition space in the Bad Ems city centre. Schloss Balmoral sees itself as an interface between artistic work and theoretical reflection and as a point of contact between former and present fellows. Balmoral intends to build a bridge between the artists' present and their future.
Since 2013, fellowships are offered in one artistic genre or one theme each year. This offering, which is unique in Germany, is intended to intensify the content-related artistic exchange among the artists present. It will also lead to a more intensive specialist exchange of ideas with external artists, speakers, teachers, curators, etc.
The conditions for all fellowships with the exception of the curator fellowship are a completed course of study in art (MFA or comparable degree) and two to three years (depending on the respective fellowship) of continuous artistic work after the conclusion of the studies until the beginning of the fellowship. Applications are also possible for autodidacts distinguished by special artistic achievements, as documented by exhibitions and prizes.
To foster artistic dialog and interdisciplinary collaboration, knowledge of English is expected.
International residential fellowships
Six residential fellowships will be awarded to international visual artists. The annual theme for the Balmoral residential fellowships 2023 is “Coexist.”
The annual theme “Coexist” deals with processes of making differences and spaces-in-between in art and society visible. Our current society is shaped by debates, movements and protests, in which an increased awareness of certain values as well as social and structural grievances is expressed. Advanced forms of digital communication and networking are having the effect of making an enormous diversity of opinions, attitudes, messages and experiences simultaneously visible as they are exchanged and shared. The current discussion of identity-political issues is not only accompanied by a revision of social values, prejudices and norms, but also by the search for new and “correct” forms of expression.
With this annual theme “Coexist,” the Kuenstlerhaus Schloss Balmoral together with its fellowship holders is shedding light on where the possibilities and boundaries of artistic action are located. The focus here will be both on aesthetic and artistic questions and on social issues.
Eligibility
Eligible to apply for a Balmoral fellowship are visual artists of any age from Germany and around the world.
The preconditions for applicants for the residential fellowships for visual artists are a completed course of study in art (M.F.A. or comparable) and three years of continuous artistic work after the conclusion of studies until the beginning of the fellowship. Applications are also possible for autodidacts distinguished by special artistic achievements, as documented by exhibitions and prizes.
Knowledge of German or English is expected.
Benefits and requirements
Balmoral fellowships are residential fellowships; continuous presence is obligatory.
The fellowships are endowed with 1,400 € a month plus subsidy to the travel costs for arrival.
Three fellowships are awarded for the period of four months and three fellowships are awarded for the period of eight months. All residential fellowships run from April each year.
All artists invited will have their registered residence in Bad Ems for the time of their stay (compulsory registration). Artists must be free of all professional commitments for the period of their fellowships.
The fellowship holders are provided free of charge with a furnished room in the artists’ residence for living and sleeping, with shower/WC and a studio. Due to the historic nature the building is not barrier-free and the apartments and studios in terms of their size and equipment are normally only suitable for one single person. The conditions of use are governed by the House Rules, which the fellowship holder must observe. The artists’ residence bears all ancillary costs including water, electricity and heating. The lounge, the dining room and the kitchen are for joint use. Pets are not admitted.
The fellows may use free of charge a in-house library containing approx. 6,000 books, mainly on modern and contemporary art, and the major art magazines.
After the fellowship acceptance, the applicant will receive an agreement concluded with the Künstlerhaus and the house rules. Once the contract has been signed by the fellowship holder, the award of the fellowship is legally binding.
Fellows are required to write a report about their stay in the Künstlerhaus Schloss Balmoral afterwards.
Additional information and application forms are available on their website. Applications must be made with these application forms. Other applications will not be taken into consideration. The deadline for application is 30 April 2022. Please find the details of the application process here.

ExtrArtis is positioned as an opportunity for dialogue on the sense of belonging to a common European space, as envisioned by the Year of Cultural Heritage, promoted and based on experimental processes that support the idea of heritage as a resource (Bucharest Declaration, 16 April 2019 - as emphasized by the European slogan ""Our Heritage: where the past meets the future"").

ExtrArtis aims to fertilize collaborations between artists, architects, heritage professionals, research and development, art world experts, collectors and communities.

In recent decades, the Frans Masereel Centrum has become one of the most challenging and inspiring environments for contemporary artists to investigate printed matter in all its aspects, or to embrace it as part of a broader artistic practice. Critics, writers, curators and academics also use their facilities, to conduct theoretical research in the private context of a dynamic arts center.
Residencies
Each year approximately 50 national and international artists, researchers, critics and academics are selected through an open call. The focus lies on development and creation within the field of print. No prior knowledge of printmaking techniques is required. The autumn season is reserved for artist collectives, master's students at colleges and universities, artistic co-workers, etc.
1. Art Student Residency
Period: September - October - November 2022
Duration: 7 days
An Art Student Residency is a unique opportunity for master's students of universities and colleges to develop a contemporary, print-related project.
2. Artist Residency
Period: January-September 2023
Duration: 5 weeks
The Artist Residency program welcomes contemporary artists to realize an individual, multiform, print-related project that matches their artistic practice. The focus lies on development and creation in one or more of our workshops.
3. Collective Residency
Period: October-November 2022
Duration: 10 days
The Collective Residency is where artist collectives, co-working art professionals or any other kind of (informal) collaboration can develop new, print-related projects or work together on common goals/themes, while learning from each other and fellow residents.
As of January 31st 2022 you can apply for a Collective Residency or an Art Student Residency.
Both residencies offer a unique opportunity to develop a contemporary, print-related project – both individually or collaboratively – or work together on common goals/themes. In a professional printmaking workshop and within the context of an international residency and exhibition space, participants are invited to experiment and realize their projects.
The deadline is 1 March 2022.

The selected participants will spend a week in either of the locations in an open format workshop. They will exchange knowledge and practice, gather material in situ, communicate with the locals and learn from a master whistler or bagpipe player/craftsman. After completion of the workshop, the participants will be given three months to produce a work to be featured in two exhibitions in Athens and Sofia. The purpose of these events is to transfer the knowledge generated during the workshops to a wider public in the capitals.
The project wishes to critically examine the interconnectedness of the two regions as a part of a wider Mediterranean cultural area. Its purpose is to gain an insight into forms of communication transmedial by nature, positioned between speaking, singing, and playing an instrument. It seeks to study various modes of thinking and to approach the cultural phenomena from a linguistic, anthropological, philosophical, holistic, and purely aural/physical standpoint.
The whistled language of Antia and the particular form of bagpipe of The Rhodope Mountains are unique cultural expressions of the Southeast European region. Even though both localities share a common historical development, the ethnographical and anthropological conditions have led to the development of unique means of expression. Understanding both communities and their aesthetics, materiality, and politics, all of which contributed to the emergence of the cultural phenomena, will provide valid points for understanding music and language as mediums shaping our contemporary society.
Both Antia and The Rhodope Mountains had thriving shepherd’s communities, which developed unique means of expression. In Antia, the whistled language ‘Sfyria’ was used by shepherds to communicate across large distances. In The Rhodope Mountains, an instrument known as the ‘Kaba Gayda’ was developed – a unique type of bagpipe. The instrument consisting of a sheep’s skin, wood and bone was used by shepherds to keep them company on their walks with the animals across The Rhodope Mountains to the Aegean Sea coast. These unique cultural forms of expression are facing a common issue. Due to primarily economic factors fewer people are left in both localities – traditional shepherding is no longer a viable way to earn a living. According to the “UNESCO Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger,” no other language in Europe has fewer living speakers than ‘Sfyria.’ In The Rhodope Mountains there are only 3 masters, all of advanced age, able to produce a ‘Kaba Gayda’ of the highest quality.
The workshops in Antia will be held in the first week of April 2023. The workshop in The Rhodope Mountains will be held in the first week of May. The exhibition in Sofia will happen in October 2023. The exhibition in Athens will happen in December 2023.
The application is open to artists and scientists of all fields, who have worked with the topic of the project or wish to do so in their future practice. Three artists and three scientists will be chosen for each of the locations. Travel expenses, accommodation for the workshop and working fee of €1000 per participant will be provided.
Application package should consist of a single PDF containing:
CV. Max 2 pages
Portfolio. Selected works, max 5 pages
Motivation. Max 300 words
Project proposal. Max 500 words

Surrounded by nature, the rural environment of Blanca allows one to enter the traditions and customs of a town in southern Spain, as well as being in coexistence with an artistic community.
Cruce is a program designed to bring together resources, spaces and knowledge. It facilitates the encounter between people of different origins, trajectories and ideas, with the common interest of being part of a temporary and caring community and of sharing experiences and knowledge.
AADK Spain is an artist-run platform that currently has its headquarters in Centro Negra (Blanca, Murcia) where it develops various programs. It advocates for the decentralization of culture and access to contemporary art in non-urban areas. They have created the program Cruce, Space for Transformation to broaden the spectrum and invite a wider audience to benefit from what our platform has to offer.
The Cruce Program began at the end of 2020 and has hosted more than 25 creators from Spain, Europe and beyond since then. It received artists from various disciplines including painting, photography, sculpture, installation, sound art and performance, and also some participants working outside the artistic field. They have been part of our beautiful temporary communities, sharing time and spaces with each other and with the participants of our other Artist Residency program.

In the midst of a global scenario that is still looking for balance, AADK Spain continues working to facilitate spaces for creation and bring our resources closer to those who need time for reflection and experimentation within their artistic practice.
""Today, our doors remain open, and we feel strangely and strongly equipped with the experience gained during these odd times. We believe that all we have experienced during the periods of confinement and social distancing has deeply impacted our idea of what is essential and what is relevant. Without a doubt, these times have also affected our sensory perception: in a matter of a few months, we became aware of the relevance of some of our most forgotten senses. The loss of smell became an indicator of our state of health, the need for bodily contact reminded us about the fragility of our emotional ties.
Touching is essential to our lives — it is estimated that within a day we touch around 150 objects and surfaces. Our contact with other human bodies is significantly less frequent than that, but nevertheless essential for our well-being. Today, touching is a gesture that invites us to redefine: how do we touch our planet?, how do we connect with other living beings and with our peers?"" - The AADK Spain team
AADK invites you to think about touch in all its complexity, reflecting, for example, on what we call textures – in image or sound – as a type of information that comes from a tactile experience. AADK considers that, already immersed in this “new normality”, it is essential to reflect on the limitations that have been imposed on touch as well as on our continuous turn towards a virtual world. Re-discovering our tactile relationship with the world and reactivating our haptic perception – that set of non-visual sensations that an individual experiences to receive information – are the proposals of this call.
Open Call deadline: 15/08/2021
AADK Spain invites all artists and researchers who wish to work on the topics of body, territory and spatiality to participate in its Artistic Residency Program. For this call, priority (not exclusive) will be given proposals that work with the topic of the haptic/tactile through any creative discipline (dance, performance, visual arts, work with new media or any other duly justified approach). Both individual and collective proposals are eligible.
About AADK
AADK Spain understands residency programs as contextualized spaces where location models the practices and modifies both its participants and the local communities. Thus, our Artistic Residency is an interdisciplinary and socially committed program that offers its attendants a space for analysis and production. It aims to facilitate research in rural environments, highlighting the value of local knowledge as a means to re-think how these locations can position themselves in an era of massive urbanization through a social, historical and geographical perspective.
Throughout their stay, participants create a temporary community that shares experiences and processes, fostering debate and a transversal perspective of their projects. AADK Spain provides tutelage and curatorial follow-up as well as assistance in production and management of projects and Open Studios night on the last Saturday of each month. Additionally, participants are encouraged to keep in touch with us after their residency ends, so that AADK can promote their work in forthcoming exhibitions curated by our platform as well as in papers, conferences and/or publications.
The amount of participants varies every month, but reaches a maximum of six projects (including individual proposals or duos/collectives).
Duration
1-6 months with 2 months being the recommended minimum for the full development of a project. The residency period starts on the first day of the first month and ends on the 30th day of the last month.
Studio/Workspace
Centro Negra is the main building of AADK Spain. It serves both as working area and exhibition space. It is located on the slope of a mountain, being reachable only by foot, and stands at the foot of a Moorish castle from the twelfth century.Its architecture is an assembly of small poultry yards and ancient houses that fell into disuse at the beginning of the twentieth century. It still retains many stone walls and mountain ledges.
The current structure is made up of 6 different and interconnected spaces. Each of them is unique in its size and morphology, constituting a set of great versatility and capable of adapting to multiple purposes. Given the morphology of the building, closed workspaces are not possible. This challenge is an opportunity to be in touch with the creative processes of other participants.
The artists will have access to: accommodation, work space, access to common areas and outdoor space, basic technical equipment, support in production, mentoring and curatorial support, visibility of the artist in the communication channels of AADK Spain. Accommodation is a private room in a shared house or individual apartment.

Proposals that critically engage with the project’s aims are welcome for application.
Started in 2021, Pressing Matter is financed by the Dutch National Science Agenda (NWA) and coordinated from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. Pressing Matter investigates the potentialities of ‘colonial objects’ to support societal attempts to deal with the colonial past and its afterlives, and with conflicting claims by different stakeholders for these objects within museums. The project will critically interrogate notions of ownership, value and return as a way of enabling more equitable futures.
Pressing Matter is done collaboratively with several museums in the Netherlands, whose collections are the central objects of study for the project. These partners are the National Museum of World Cultures, Museum Bronbeek, Museum Vrolik, Rijksmuseum, the museums of Utrecht University and Groningen University. In addition, several other academic and societal institutions are partners in the project. These include the Foundation Academic Heritage and the NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies. Societal partners are Imagine IC, The Black Archives, HAPIN Papua Support Foundation, the Rijksakademie, Framer Framed and the Peace Palace Library, the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands and DutchCulture.
Pressing Matter connects fundamental theories of valuation and property to postcolonial debates on heritage, to develop and test, first, new theoretical models of value and ownership and, second, new forms of return that extend current approaches to heritage restitution. Central to the project’s aims is to develop a theory of object potentialities grounded in the entangled, multipolar histories in which colonial objects were collected, kept and made meaningful. Organised around 8 work packages, the project addresses the following questions:
What potential do objects (cultural and biological, including human remains and academic medical collections) collected during the colonial period contain to help us better understand the colonial past and address its ongoing legacies in the postcolonial Netherlands and Europe? (Q1)
What conceptions of ownership do different stakeholders – museums, curators, scientists, members of originating communities – invoke in their claims to colonial objects? (Q2)
Through what regimes of value do these different groups of stakeholders interpret and make claims on colonial objects? Under what circumstances can these regimes and conceptions become compatible? (Q3)
What museological practices may help to reconcile the interests of different stakeholders in order to create more equitable and inclusive societies and to support a more sustainable and equitable (re)distribution of heritage? (Q4)
Participating artists are invited to think about the ways in which art practice can reimagine different forms of return, repair, and reconciliation broadly conceived, working with objects/collections in the partner museums collected during the colonial period.
It is desired to receive proposals that not only challenge current dominant conceptions but also propose alternative visions for how ownership and value, return and repair can be reimagined in the service of new ethics of relations grounded in more just and equitable futures.
Project proposals must demonstrate a strong commitment to the intellectual and societal goals of the project and thereby contribute to the multidisciplinary research ecology of Pressing Matter. The selected artist will contribute to the intellectual life of the project, including active participation in the repair lab, an on- and offline site for interdisciplinary and transnational conversation and experimentation about repairing historical injustices linked to museums and their collections.
Artists can use the residency to produce a new (body of) work or complete work already in progress that is germane to the questions of Pressing Matter. The artist in residence will be required to do public presentations to showcase work or research done during the residency.
Pressing Matter adopts a broad understanding of the term artist, inviting individual or collaborative projects, across any art-related discipline. Proposals for both physical and conceptual work are welcome, not limited to any media.
Applications from emerging, mid-career and established artists who demonstrate a commitment to the project’s intellectual and societal aims are welcome.
The residency takes between 3 – 12 months starting from September 2022. The residency program will end in December 2024.
Pressing Matter offers;
Travel expenses to the Netherlands (for artists living outside the Netherlands).
Stipend, covering living costs in the Netherlands (including a contribution to accommodation) and negotiable depending on the type of project.
Studio space at the Rijksakademie.
Pressing Matter will provide suitable accommodation for successful applicants living outside the Netherlands.
Material and production costs (TBD depending on project requirements).

The initiative HIER & JETZT:Connections defines exile as the involuntary loss of one’s social context and working environment in their country of origin for an uncertain period of time.
The project is complemented by a series of lectures, workshops, and discussions held by artists, experts, and researchers in order to create a space for dialogue, mutual learning and understanding.
Successful applicants are invited to work at B.L.O. Ateliers in Berlin for a period of three months. Additionally, a budget of 500 € is offered to each resident or group for production costs.

Housed in historic, landmark buildings, the residency program offers ten artists each month the opportunity to live and work in the heart of a rural community. The Wassaic Project seeks artists working in a diverse range of media who want to produce, explore, challenge, and expand their current art-making practices while participating in a community-based arts organization.
Family Residency Program
The Wassaic Project broadly defines “family” as a group of more than one individual where there is an in-house dependent relationship as a necessary caregiver. The Wassaic Project recognizes that artists who have caregiving relationships, as providers or recipients, often opt-out of peer community building for practical reasons. The Wassaic Project aims to provide accommodations which increase access to our residency program.
Examples of caregiving may include, but are not limited to: parent/child (parent is caregiver), child/parent (child is caregiver), partner/partner (where one partner is a supportive caregiver of the other and cohabitation is required for caregiving), a recipient of caregiving, a self-selection into this application for separate and additional housing space by identifying as a family applicant.
Studios, Facilities, Accomodation
Artists-in-residence will receive an adaptable semi-private studio space in the historic Maxon Mills. All studios are ~100 square feet. Artists-in-residence will have 24-hour access to their studio and accommodations which include a private bedroom in a shared house (complete with common spaces, 1–2 full bathrooms, fully stocked kitchen, etc). Artists participating through the Family program will receive a private house. Artists-in-residence also have access to workshop facilities, including a wood shop and a ceramics studio.
Financial Information
The actual cost of each residency is $5,000 per month, which includes a semi-private studio, private bedroom, full use of facilities, visiting artist program, studio visits, insurance, and staff support. In an effort to serve and support emerging artists, it is attempted to subsidize residencies for all individual artists who do not have other forms of support. Thanks to the generous support of donors and grants, the artist’s contribution for the winter residency program is $600 per a 4-week period.
There is also a need-based financial assistance available to artists-in-residence for whom it would be impossible to attend without financial support. Financial need is self-reported by artists in their applications.
Application

1–10 work samples
CV (3 pages max)

Proposal: What makes you curious, what you are interested in investigating, and what your jumping off point would be. (200 words max)
Optional question: Artists' own definition of success matters. Are there additional criteria that you would like the panel to consider when reviewing your work? For example: What do you consider to be a successful piece or process? If you work with a community, the artistic product may not be the sole or most important creation of the work.

Now a site for exhibitions and artist residencies, Van Gogh House’s mission is to support artists in their lifetimes. The programme sees ambitious annual commissions alongside thoughtful live-in residencies during which time the house is closed to the public.
Van Gogh House in London announces a one-month residency at in June 2022 for a Dutch artist duo. This opportunity has been supported by the Dutch Embassy in the United Kingdom, and draws a connection between the site in London and Vincent van Gogh’s homeland.

Radar Sofia runs and coordinates Drama Pact, an informal union of playwrights and dramaturges in Sofia and abroad, and an initiative to support and promote contemporary dramaturgy. Radar Sofia is funded by Bulgaria’s National Culture Fund under its one-year grant scheme in 2022.
Open Call 2022: Distance and Resistance
Radar Sofia is announcing an open call for artists for 3 fully-funded residencies in Sofia, Bulgaria in 2022 under its year-long programme Distance and Resistance.
Every year Radar Sofia proposes a curatorial line with a main theme and a series of guest artists – invited or selected through an international open call – who give a lecture or workshop sharing their methods and practices, and/or create a performance involving local participants in the work process. One of the aims of these curatorial lines is to develop the local artistic field through critical discourse, free non-formal education and new experimental formats, as well as to create opportunities for Bulgarian artists to form partnerships and collaborate with international professionals. Radar Sofia as an international place for experimental artistic practice has so far created and supported numerous spin-off projects coming up as a result of the residencies. You can look at their website for the full list of previous residents and projects.
Social distancing, border closures, postponement of plans and projects, cancellation of festivals and residencies as well as a general sense of growing isolationism made us choose the theme of Distance and Resistance. If the situation with the pandemic only intensifies and makes visible what we've already been living through for a long time – a migration from the physical to the digital world, increasing work insecurity, social and physical distancing – then how does our artistic practice respond to these processes, how does it resist them, how does it offer alternatives and how does it distance itself from the ready-made solutions? Radar Sofia is the first and only residency in the Bulgarian context, focused on dramaturgy understood in a very broad sense. They ask you and themselves: what can dramaturgy contribute to the world of today, how can it bring people together and how can it help re-imagine our contexts?
They believe the digital cannot be the only alternative during health and climate catastrophes, especially for artistic practices rooted in the live body and the meeting between people, that's why they insist on offering physical residencies, live in Sofia.
Timeslots
The residencies last for a minimum of 1 month, with a possibility for extension.
1. Residency starting in May, deadline Feb. 1, response by Feb 15
2. Residency starting in June, deadline March 1, response by March 15
3. Residency starting in September/October, deadline May 31, response by June 15
Artists who are interested in the local situation in Sofia, want to show and share their previous work, interact with local communities, research and develop new ideas, as well as form long-lasting partnerships in Bulgaria are welcome to apply.
Eligibility
They accept applicants from all performative fields, with a special focus on dramaturgical thinking (understood as wide as possible), which is at the core of the practice at Radar Sofia, spanning across disciplines. They welcome performing arts makers, playwrights, dramaturges, directors, performers, choreographers, as well as visual artists and curators working with live art, performance art, relational aesthetics, interactivity, community engagement and other old and new performative practices.

Given the institutional profile and the general socio-political context in Ukraine, IZOLYATSIA is specifically interested in socially and politically engaged art practices, activism, urbanism, creative industries, public art and community-based art. Art practitioners employing different media to investigate post-industrial regeneration, complex socio-political matters of migration and displacement, contested histories and geopolitical issues, are given preference.
Since 2010, IZOLYATSIA has held art residencies in Ukraine, hosting individual artists, initiating multidisciplinary research and curatorial residencies as well as facilitated Ukrainian art professionals’ residencies at the partnering institutions abroad. IZOLYATSIA Residency Programme provides a supportive environment for art practice and fosters creative artistic exchanges between artists and various art professionals in Ukraine and abroad.
IZOLYATSIA Residency Programme offers time, space and professional support for work, reflection, research, production, and experimentation. Professional support may range from technical assistance, assistance in finding local resources and in navigating the city of Kyiv, as well as other cities across Ukraine, to studio visits and peer-to-peer discussions. Residents are also welcome to use IZOLYATSIA’s library and archive, including the unique Donbas Studies corpus. Moreover, residents will have a chance to get acquainted with and research Ukraine with its rich contested historical heritage and contemporary situation as a Post-Soviet country with its contextual, ideological issues. IZOLYATSIA also has facilities to provide accommodation for group of people up to 3 persons. More details are available upon request.
IZOLYATSIA Residency Programme provides two types of residencies:
- thematic group residencies with curatorial supervision;
- individual self-directed residencies. The recommended duration of the residence is 1 month.
Currently there are no scholarships or support funds attached to this programme. However, selected candidates are issued a letter of support for individual grant seeking. The resident is expected to provide one open event in various formats such as a master-class, seminar, off-site lecture, open studio day, training course, etc.

There are typically 5 residents at the Anderson Center at a time, and the organization hosts approximately 35-40 residents each year.
As an interdisciplinary arts organization, the Anderson Center embraces artists who are diverse in every way.

All 2022 residencies are 4-weeks in duration. Multi-disciplinary sessions consist of between 6 and 7 artists, all of whom arrive and depart at the same time, ensuring a deeply shared experience. Residents are provided a private bedroom in a fully renovated 1840s farmhouse, a private studio and chef-prepared dinners five nights a week.
Shared amenities include a communal kitchen, common area for group gatherings, library, 25 art/nature trails, wireless internet, a wood-fired sauna out by the pond, floating living room and a workshop outfitted with tools, materials and equipment.
The residency is self-directed and non-judgmental. Artists decide themselves on their work and timeline. I-Park’s resourceful staff is devoted to providing each artist with a fulfilling, productive and comfortable residency experience. Ambitious installation projects on the I-Park grounds are welcome, and there is a small budget for materials, equipment and labor for approved projects.
Assuming the Covid-19 landscape permits, each residency will conclude with an Open Studios event, in which members of the public are invited to meet the artists, experience their works and explore the I-Park grounds.
Except for a $35 application fee to help defray the cost of the discipline-specific selection panels, the residencies are fully-funded. Artists need only pay for their art supplies and transportation to and from the area. Complimentary shuttle service to a Connecticut airport or bus/train station is offered at the beginning and end of the residency session.
Application Process
Applications are adjudicated by five selection panels consisting of independent experts with discipline-specific strengths. The composition of the panels changes each year.
Please check the FAQ before beginning the application process — to be sure the program is a good fit for you. In particular, if you are an I-Park fellow, check page 2 to be certain you are eligible for a return residency at this time.
The I-Park Residency Program is set within a 450-acre nature preserve, with open fields, miles of walking trails and stone walls, ponds, a diverse natural habit including teeming wetlands areas, a second generation forest and a pristine river. This quiet, retreat-type environment is especially conducive to the creative process — and has, over the years, inspired a special interest in site-responsive ephemeral art.
The deadline for application is 17 January 2022.

Applications are open to participants from the Nordic European region: Åland Islands, Denmark, Estonia, Faroe Islands, Finland, Greenland, Iceland, Latvia, Norway, and Sweden. The residency will be carried out in four time periods: March–May 2022, October–December 2022, January–March 2023, and October–December 2023.
The Neringa Forest Architecture (NFA) project is located at NAC in Nida on the Curonian Spit, a 98km-long sand dune shared by Lithuania and Russia, separating the Curonian Lagoon from the Baltic Sea. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site where forests planted over the span of 200 years form an environment dedicated to managing natural eolian processes.
NFA focuses on the features of both the human-made and natural forest: its ecological rhythms, organic and industrial material cycles, timber-based material development, socio-political discourses, history, forestry and policy-making; art, design and architecture.
NFA analyses this cultural landscape as a case study in the context of Baltic and Scandinavian forests by tracing the relationship between ecological, recreational, representational, and industrial narratives, and by presenting the possibility to perceive the forest as an infrastructure formed by a diverse civic consensus. In this residency, the trees of the Curonian forest and all of its distinct eco-socio-political features are literally, and figuratively, the foundational material of the programme.
Living and working conditions
Each resident of the programme is provided with a 65m2 live/work space equipped with basic kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, and workspace facilities. Additionally, full access is given to the communal spaces such as the library and the workshops (with weaving looms, ceramic kiln, laser cutting, basic wood and metalworking tools, photo, video and sound equipment).
NFA invites participants to work with naturally seasoned, Neringa-sourced, timber logged over the past two winters. Sturdy, uneven mountain pines, birch, maple, black alder, rubinia, chestnut and other type of trees growing on the spit, cut in planks of various sizes, or in blocks are stored in the NFA timber archive / library ready to be studied and used for the prototyping of furniture, musical instruments, and any other objects by the programme participants at the NAC timber workshop.
The programme can host up to five residents at a time. In addition to the residency programme, NAC organises art and research projects, exhibitions and events. NAC is a subdivision of Vilnius Academy of Arts and hosts students’ seminars and work retreats.
Each selected resident / collective will receive a monthly grant of 900 EUR and additional travel costs.
Application requirements

Portfolio, sample of work, or publications (selection of 3–5 relevant projects)

WHO
The residency is aimed at foreign published writers with a palpable, factual relation with any of the other UNESCO Cities of Literature that has to be apparent and described as part of the application. This means the applicant was or has been living in one of the other 41 cities of literature or is related to a city of literature through work.
The applicant must have published at least one book of fiction (be it prose, poetry or drama) in their language. There are no restrictions regarding age, race, gender or nationality. Though writers of all genres are currently welcome to apply, a specific focus might be chosen for calls in the following years.
FINAL DEADLINE FOR APPLICATIONS: 31 January 2022
WHAT IS OFFERED
Each resident will get a sum amount of the grant and travel expenses of €1000 gross in total (details regarding potential wire-transfer charges and other expenses can be found in the contract). Each resident will stay in their own, separate and fully equipped apartment with a kitchenette at Švicarija/Swisshouse, along with other artists-residents, artists, and exhibitions.
Local public transportation costs will be covered. Access to the Internet will be provided. Through targeted activities and networking possibilities, suited to each resident’s profile, the organisers will help them get to know the vibrant art and literary scene in Ljubljana. Opportunities for public presentation of the residents’ work will be made possible, as well as meetings with translators, if necessary and/or applicable. During the resident’s stay, some group activities, such as meetings with the organizer, publishers etc., may be scheduled. Residents are required to take care of medical insurance and are responsible for their meals and household. Additional guests cannot be hosted.
WHAT IS EXPECTED
The resident is encouraged to show an interest, and partake, in local literary events and other related activities—which will be coordinated according to other local events as well as the needs and interests of the given resident—however, at least one public performance (e.g., a reading of the piece, completed at the residency) is expected. Unless agreed otherwise, there are no additional honoraria for these activities.
LOCATION
Švicarija/Swisshouse Creative Centre is a cultural, educational and social hub located in the heart of Ljubljana’s central park—situated just a few steps from the city centre—which offers public programmes, studio facilities for local artists, and residencies for international artists and experts. Given the current situation, the house may be more empty than usual, which could make the place a bit more suitable for people that seek quiet time for writing.
Švicarija is part of MGLC – International Centre of Graphic Arts, a specialised museum, producer of printed and contemporary art, and provider of artist residencies, based on the heritage of the 20th century art of printing and Biennial of Graphic Arts, Ljubljana, world’s oldest printmaking biennale which has been running uninterrupted since 1955.
Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, was a World Book Capital in 2010. After being awarded a UNESCO City of Literature in 2015, it joined a world-wide network of cities (42 in total), and committed to actively promote literature, reading culture, and engage in activities that would strengthen the collaboration in the field of writing and publishing. Ljubljana bursts with a vibrant art scene and offers an array of diverse literary events from alternative performances to big international festivals. The residency, established in 2018, offers peace and quiet for uninterrupted writing, yet it also offers the possibility to actively engage in the city’s literary life.
HOW TO APPLY
Please check further on the eligibility criteria and application form on their website.
Send your application (in a .doc or .pdf file) to [email protected].

Commissioning artists to create new works critically engaging with intercultural ideas of privacy, agency, and trust in relation to artificial intelligence (AI) and other data-driven technologies, the programme is aimed at artists interested in exploring the international landscape for AI ethics, governance, and regulation. Three artists will be supported to develop new works within a 6-month remote residency programme, with final works presented by Somerset House in 2022. The aim of the project is to examine how the three interrelated values of privacy, agency, and trust work together in the very different cultural contexts of the UK and Japan in relation to AI and other data-driven technologies.
Applications are invited from artists in any international location and from any discipline, with an interest in exploring the interrelated values of privacy, agency, and trust in human-AI ecosystems across different cultural contexts. Engaging with the findings of the PATH-AI interim report as a starting point, it is anticipated that artists will already be considering these themes in their existing work. Joining the Somerset House Studios community via a remote residency over a 6-month period, the artists will be supported to develop their project, to be published online within the Somerset House programme. Where artworks are not designed to live primarily online, the process and outcomes will be documented, and the resulting film shared as a project outcome.
The residency includes
Artist fee £5000 (inclusive of Vat or equivalent local sales tax where applicable)
Production budget £5000 (inclusive of Vat or equivalent local sales tax where applicable)
Curatorial and artist development support from Somerset House Studios
Access to online technical and advisory support in creative technology from the UAL Creative Computing Institute, (e.g. Natural Language Processing, Generative AI image processing, Sound and games design, Human and Computer interaction etc.)
Regular advisory meetings with researchers from The Alan Turing Institute to access expertise from the humanities and social sciences around intercultural concepts of privacy, agency and trust as they relate to AI and data-driven technologies in the UK and Japan.
A dedicated mentor, brokered through Somerset House Studios
Artist Outcome: online work + screen based element to be shown at Somerset House
Access to any artist development programmes or opportunities for Somerset House Studios artists made available during the course of the residency

His visit to Amsterdam inspired Dutch artists, politicians and people interested in culture exchange, to set up an artists-in-residence program. The main objective of the Foundation is to advance cultural exchange between artists from Africa, the Netherlands and Amsterdam in particular. To this aim, the Foundation engages artists from African continent and diaspora of all disciplines of contemporary visual art (painting, drawing, photography, sculpture, video, film, audio and multi media) to work for three months in the Thami Mnyele Foundation studio, located in an old school building in the centre of Amsterdam. The Thami Mnyele Foundation Residency Award is therefore an ideal opportunity for concentration on work, reflection, research and discussion. The artist in residence receives a grant for living expenses and a budget for material and the travelling expenses to and from the Netherlands. In order to promote this cultural exchange, the Thami Mnyele Foundation mediates in meetings with artists and people associated with the Dutch art world. The selection of participants is done on a regular basis by an independent selection committee of experts, which is appointed by the Board of the Foundation.
The Thami Mnyele Foundation Residency Award is now open to new applications for a unique three-month residency program in Amsterdam. Artists from Africa and diaspora of all disciplines of contemporary visual art, such as painting, sculpture, installation, media art and performing art are welcome.

anaphylactic shock from the venomous sting to his head and neck, from which he died instantly under
the waters of the Mediterranean.
The seed Arnau has left as his legacy is the motivation and commitment to the above values, which the initiative aims to divulge. In this spirit and with this clear objective, Arnau’s close relatives and friends have founded a non-profit organisation to organise and carry out activities and awards in his memory, the ENFooCA Awards Arnau Bartrina Luque.

Biennale College Musica 2022 is dedicated to experimental musical theatre, the theme chosen by the director Lucia Ronchetti for the 66th International Festival of Contemporary Music of La Biennale di Venezia (Out of Stage, 14 > 25 September 2022): “New musical theatre – states Lucia Ronchetti – has for decades invaded new types of spaces, leaving the historic stages to create different dramaturgical contexts, using new video technologies, virtual reality techniques and the spatialization of amplified sound, based on different dramaturgical forms specific to each project. The innate theatrical quality of the concert ritual is amplified, developing what Mauricio Kagel defined as instrumental theatre, a non-vocal sonic theatre, in which the instrumental gesture becomes performance and generates new characters and new stage presences”.
The calls are aimed at the selection of:
1 composer to compose a work of music theatre for solo voice or solo instrument and percussion trio (electronics optional) lasting from 30 to 45 minutes
1 composer to create a site-specific sound installation for a site in Venice proposed by the Biennale Musica
1 composer to compose a work for radio inspired by John Cage’s Sounds of Venice, a piece that the American composer presented on Rai television in Milan in 1959 on the show Lascia o raddoppia
2 experimental performers (djs / turntablists / controllerists / beatmakers and live electronics performers) interested in the theatrical aspects of performance for the creation of two new works
4 performers (sopranos, clarinettists, harpists, percussionists) interested in the chamber repertory of Georges Aperghis’ musical theatre.
The young talents selected for Biennale College Musica 2022 will develop and produce their projects between March and September 2022 participating in specific theoretical and practical sessions under the guidance of a team of tutors that include: Ondrej Adámek, composer and conductor (Prague); Brigitta Muntendorf, composer (Cologne); Gianluca Ruggeri from Ars Ludi, percussionist and conductor (Rome); X.Lee, experimental performer and composer (Los Angeles); Antonello Pocetti, director and dramaturge (Bologna); and Thierry Coduys, sound engineer and computer music expert (Nice), who will work at the Computer Music and Multimedia Centre of La Biennale di Venezia (Centro di Informatica Musicale e Multimediale – CIMM).
At the end of the training and production programme, all the works created during the process – the musical theatre work, the sound installation, the work for radio, the two experimental performances, the concert featuring musical theatre pieces from the repertory by Aperghis – will make their debut on the stages of the 66th International Festival of Contemporary Music of La Biennale di Venezia (14 - 25 September 2022).

The exhibition looks for points of contact between people, technology and nature. The technological art installations consisting of sounds, lights, texts, sculptures or their online counterparts are placed in natural spaces like forests, fields, swamps and lakes.
With this open call Maajaam is seeking proposals for installations, interventions or processes to be installed/performed in landscapes spread out around Maajaam that explore the human condition in a contemporary technological society. The artworks should withstand outdoor conditions.
Maajaam is situated in an old farmhouse, but is nonetheless operated as a media art experimentation residency. It lies on the frontier of these overlapping normalities, extending an invitation to contemplate, question and explore the aspects of a technological society, its influence on our behaviour, perception and thinking as well as on our surrounding environments.
The residency will take place in the summer of 2022. The residency lasts for 3 weeks. The produced works will remain in Maajaam and will be displayed on satellite exhibitions in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania until 2025. This is the first of multiple open calls to find works for Wild Bits exhibitions during 2022 - 2025.
Three to five projects will be selected for the 2022 residency period. All artists from around the world are eligible to apply. Selected projects receive an artist fee of €2000 and a travel grant. The average budget per project is €5000. The production will be assisted by organizers by providing production facilities, tools, local manufacturing partners, specialized know-how and a smoke sauna experience.
Selection
Main selection criteria:
suitability of the idea considering the assignment
feasibility of the production plan
environmental impact of the project
project’s ability to relate to the surrounding landscape
The selected works for this call are partly funded by Tartu 2024 European Capital of Culture and Kaunas 2022 European Capital of Culture. One artist will be selected from Lithuania as the residency is co-funded by Kaunas 2022 European Capital of Culture.
The collaborator from Lithuania will be the landscape design festival Magenta, an official partner of Kaunas 2022. The Magenta festival will present three of the selected works to Lithuanian audiences in September 2022.

In a 6-months collaboration starting in March 2022, the selected artist will work closely together with academic researchers towards an artistic intervention. Rather than communicating science, we aim to explore new ways to configure artistic and scientific approaches to imagine low-carbon futures that could incite a more meaningful climate debate.
Recent catastrophic weather events and the 2021 IPCC report contributed to the mounting evidence that it is important to limit global warming. To achieve the goals of the Paris agreement and delimit global warming to well below 2°C, preferably 1.5 °C degrees, requires a stunning effort amounting to rapid and radical transformation towards a low-carbon society. But as climate impacts are becoming visible, it becomes increasingly hard to imagine true alternatives to a catastrophic future. This lack of ‘imaginaries’ of futures, that are both sustainable and just, hamper the transition.
As part of the European research project Climaginaries, exploring and innovating new ways of imagining climate futures, this collaboration is embedded in a PhD project on exploring new roles for climate modelling in imagining low-carbon futures. The selected artists will work closely with Lisette van Beek and the Urban Futures Studio to jointly explore possible ways to intervene in the climate debate, collaboratively identify possible art-science configurations and co-develop the intervention. The Jan van Eyck Academie acts as a supporting partner in this art-science collaboration.
About the Urban Futures Studio
The Urban Futures Studio is a transdisciplinary institute devoted to studying positive futures and ways to get there; a small group of researchers that explore existing futures practices as well as initiate experiments to imagine climate, energy and urban futures. Past examples of interventions include The Energetic Odyssey, the Post-fossil City Contest and the Carbon Ruins exhibition.
Candidate profile
Artists based in the Netherlands with an interest in and knowledge of the climate emergency and its (social, geopolitical, economical) effects are eligible to apply. Candidates have a strong ability to conceptualize possible futures, experience in staging artistic interventions, and know how to engage with different publics. Candidates have affinity with science and have experience with or are motivated to collaborate with researchers from a range of different backgrounds.
Offer
Embedded in the Urban Future Studio of Utrecht University, the art-science collaboration will involve conducting research, exploring various ways to engage different publics in imagining low-carbon future, and co-developing an artistic intervention.
Collaboration period: March - August 2022 (6 months)
Total budget: 15,000 euro
The artist will have a desk at the Urban Futures Studio (Utrecht Science Park).
Access to experts from various backgrounds and disciplines from Utrecht University and beyond, access to the university library and other resources.
Access to Lab facilities and expertise of the Jan van Eyck Academie in Maastricht for the production of the artistic intervention. The language spoken is either English or Dutch.
Application procedure
To apply, please submit a single pdf (no larger than 10 MB) of the following materials, presented in English, to [email protected]
A motivational letter
A proposal (max 500 w.) explaining your approach to this art-science collaboration and the intervention
A curriculum vitae (max 2 pages)
Documentation of previous work (max 25 pages with 1 – 2 images per page. The presented material should not be older than 5 years). For voluminous files like videos, please insert links to Vimeo, YouTube or other channels to watch the materials

Rather than communicating science, we aim to explore new ways to configure artistic and scientific approaches to imagine low-carbon futures that could incite a more meaningful climate debate.</p><p>Recent catastrophic weather events and the 2021 IPCC report contributed to the mounting evidence that it is important to limit global warming. To achieve the goals of the Paris agreement and delimit global warming to well below 2°C, preferably 1.5 °C degrees, requires a stunning effort amounting to rapid and radical transformation towards a low-carbon society. But as climate impacts are becoming visible, it becomes increasingly hard to imagine true alternatives to a catastrophic future. This lack of ‘imaginaries’ of futures, that are both sustainable and just, hamper the transition.</p><p>As part of the European research project Climaginaries, exploring and innovating new ways of imagining climate futures, this collaboration is embedded in a PhD project on exploring new roles for climate modelling in imagining low-carbon futures. The selected artists will work closely with Lisette van Beek and the Urban Futures Studio to jointly explore possible ways to intervene in the climate debate, collaboratively identify possible art-science configurations and co-develop the intervention. The Jan van Eyck Academie acts as a supporting partner in this art-science collaboration.</p><p><br><strong>About the Urban Futures Studio</strong><br> The Urban Futures Studio is a transdisciplinary institute devoted to studying positive futures and ways to get there; a small group of researchers that explore existing futures practices as well as initiate experiments to imagine climate, energy and urban futures. Past examples of interventions include <a href=https://www.uu.nl/en/research/urban-futures-studio/initiatives/2050-an-energetic-odyssey>The Energetic Odyssey</a>, the<a href=http://postfossil.city/en> Post-fossil City Contest</a> and the <a href=https://www.climaginaries.org/carbon-ruins>Carbon Ruins exhibition</a>.</p><p><strong>Candidate profile</strong><br> Artists based in the Netherlands with an interest in and knowledge of the climate emergency and its (social, geopolitical, economical) effects are eligible to apply.

The objective of the residency is to address Konsthall C as an infrastructure and explore possible futures for an organization that wants to work not only with decolonization but in a decolonial way. Applicants should demonstrate innovative methods based on mutual learning and joint exploration of new ideas and approaches.
The resident will work in close proximity to the staff and our program through engagement with Konsthall C’s history, its future ambitions, relevance in the community and its approach to (re)presenting art.
Selected applicants are invited to work with any aspect of Konsthall C’s organisational structure and program to help uncover new ways of building an accountable and open institutional structure. The focus is on finding ways of how to explore the relationship between decoloniality and contemporary art. The organization particularly focuses on the injustice and structural issues within, ways of how to unlearn the practices and behaviors that have emerged from these conditions, and seeks to build anew along antiracist and decolonized lines.
Two residents will be selected for a residency of eight weeks during the winter and spring of 2022. The applicants' background should display hybrid modes of thought, research, and practice within a decolonial framework. It is open to all nationalities.
Residency periods are designed as between 1 February – 13 March and 11 May – 26 June. Applications to be made via their online form. Deadline for application is on 12 December 2021 at 11 PM.

Artists interested in applying to Collide are invited to submit a project proposal that combines research and production. The scope of this proposal will include a research period at CERN and a second developmental phase in Barcelona, where the artists will have the opportunity to expand their research through Barcelona’s rich scientific and cultural network, as well as to engage with a wide range of communities.
CERN is the largest physics laboratory in the world, where the fundamental structure of matter and the origin of the universe are studied. Through Arts at CERN, artists from all over the globe and from all creative disciplines are invited to spend time at CERN and work alongside particle physicists, engineers and staff. During this process, the artists become a part of the lab community and experience how fundamental science pursues the big questions about our universe. Building on these important principles of openness and collaboration, the Collide residency programme has flourished, bringing these two creative cultures together, and is now a renowned model for art and science engagement. The established collaborations with cities have helped broaden the reach of our mission to other communities and contexts. Since 2019, we have proudly partnered with Barcelona, a city that hosts some of the leading cultural and scientific communities and organizations in Europe.
Collide grants one artist or a collective a fully-funded residency at CERN in Geneva and Barcelona. The artist will spend two months at CERN, followed by a one-month stay in Barcelona (not necessarily consecutively). The exact timing of the residency will be defined after the
announcement in conversation with the artist. It may occur after May 2022. If an artistic collective is the recipient of the residency award, a maximum of two members will be invited to stay simultaneously as residents. The budget will remain the same, with the possibility of splitting the grant between the members.
A maximum of two Honorary Mentions may be announced. The recipients will be invited to be part of CERN’s Guest Artist programme, consisting of a two-day exploratory visit to the Laboratory. At least one Honorary Mention will be awarded to an artist residing in Barcelona.
The award includes the following support and conditions:
15.000 Swiss Francs as a research and artistic production award.
Personal allowance for two months at CERN in Geneva and one month in Barcelona. − Travel and accommodation costs within a fixed budget for the three months of the artistic residency at CERN and in Barcelona.
Application deadline is 22 November 2021, 11:59 PM (CET).
Artists intending to apply shall submit a proposal adhering to the criteria of the call. The application should be written in English and submitted via the online form that can be found at Arts at CERN’s website or here.","","","<div class=""field field--name-field-body field--type-entity-reference-revisions field--label-hidden field__items""><div class=field__item> <div class=""paragraph paragraph--type--text paragraph--view-mode--full""><div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-paragraph-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item""><p>Artists across all countries and creative disciplines are invited to submit a project proposal for a research-led residency at CERN in Geneva and in various laboratories and research centres in Barcelona, while being hosted at the Hangar Centre for Art Research and Production.</p><p>Artists interested in applying to Collide are invited to submit a project proposal that combines research and production.

The Regional S+T+ARTS Centers focus on a ​resource, urban​, ​ICT & ​art-driven​ transformation as the path towards reconfiguring the current social, cultural and economic landscape.
As a first step, each Regional S+T+ARTS Center has gathered a group of local experts and together defined 21 challenges in their localities. The 21 challenges have been informed by the EU Green Deal, the New European Bauhaus and the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals to reflect pan-European or global issues that nonetheless, require a focus on local regions.
S+T+ARTS now calls for international artists to join in coming up with solutions to these challenges in 21 artist fellowships. The fellowships will encourage artists to critique the present, explore beyond its current limitations and reimagine sustainable futures.
It is seeked to have artists with a strong motivation to help change behaviours, reduce waste, fight climate change, improve energy efficiency or make cities and communities more sustainable - in essence, a motivation to challenge existing actions and propose more responsible and sustainable ones. Besides the motivation, artists should have proven experience working with technologies (with a focus on ICT technologies) and integrating them into their artistic practice.
The call is open to professional individual artists and collectives from any art-related field, excited and ready to collaborate with a network of experts and technology (ICT) professionals in addressing local challenges. Previous experience in collaboration with industrial companies and/or research institutions will be valued, but is not a condition for participation.
Throughout the fellowships, artists are expected to engage with regional issues, local communities and local expert groups to expand their role in society and integrate their artistic practice with the development process of innovative solutions. The goal of the proposals should be the development of a thought-provoking hybrid between an artwork and a prototype that seamlessly bridges between art and technology and proposes a solution with both functional and artistic value to a real-life issue. Furthermore, artists should aim to break the old dichotomies between autonomous and applied art and create space for novel approaches.
What is offered?
Budget up to EUR 40.000 for artist fellowships to cover the artist fee and other fellowship-related costs (including but not limited to artwork/prototype production, transportation to joint Prototyping Park exhibitions, travel and accommodation expenses, insurance)
Access to the regional fellowship host organisation and local expert group
Access to the Europe-wide S+T+ARTS network
Access to new technologies and R&D departments
Participation in Prototyping Parks showcasing the outcomes of the fellowships at MAXXI Rome, ZKM Karlsruhe, as well as at regional locations of the Regional S+T+ARTS Centers upon selection
Visibility through high impact communication activities to promote the artistic output and its innovation spillovers (including dissemination events foreseen from July-December 2022)
Fellowship will take place between February 2022 – August 2022. Exhibiting & impact dissemination is scheduled for September 2022- December 2022. The budget allocated per challenge is €40.000. The deadline for application is 21 November 2021 at 13:00 CET.
Regional S+T+ARTS Centres: Snowball (Coord., BE), MAXXI Museum (IT), Art Hub Copenhagen (DK), STATE (DE), Onassis Stegi (EL), In4Art (NL), MEET (IT), CCCB (ES), Ars Electronica (AT), SONY CSL Lab (FR), Kersnikova (SI), CYENS Centre of Excellence (CY).

Submissions should focus on the dialogue between human beings and nature so as to create an artistic Land Art itinerary in the area. 7 projects from different artistic disciplines will be selected to be developed and produced in the natural environment during the two weeks of the Art Residency, sharing experiences, ideas and a common goal.
Deadline for applications: 10th of October 2021.
All projects must take into consideration people's interest in contemporary arts, aiming to give greater value to the area of Vall de Gallinera, promoting a deep and permanent conscience about the historical, cultural and traditional aspects of the territory through a dialogue between art and nature.
Concept
""Truly memory does not consist at all of a regression from the present to the past, but rather in a progress from the past to the present."" Bergson H., Matter and Memory, 2006.
The power of intangibleness in art could be considered to be the core of creation and transformation: perception, habits, culture, language, time or memory can be channels used to define artistic research.
This symbiosis between tangible and immaterial is what, along with history, builds the identity of a territory. There are many important elements in Vall de Gallinera apart from its geologic structure and its natural heritage, like for example the vestiges from prehistory up to the civil war, passing through Iberian villages, funerary steles and medieval castles. This historical legacy, traces of human beings along the millennia, has been preserved in this enclave thanks to its natural idiosyncrasy. They are the physical result of a non-linear time that presents a dialogue of human beings with nature through its layers. These layers could be metaphorically a book (nature itself) where the territory's inhabitants have written their story and defined their identity.
Nature has since forever been a spiritual source of research and inspiration for human beings. It is not a coincidence that one can see trees in the forms of the columns in the churches, or caves in the arches, and many other examples. This union appears represented in different styles and functions, and in what remains when time and various factors alter them.
Due to this connection between absence/presence that is preserved nowadays, the inner identity has been reinforced with nature as witness. These are the elements that the selected artists will be invited to reinterpret through their projects.
Enclave Land Art aims to start a new chapter, leaving a contemporary trace to continue this dialogue with the environment through contemporary art. The relationship with what remains, together with what is not visible but nonetheless is present and forms part of Vall de Gallinera's people, represents who the locals are nowadays as a result of the path trodden.

Novels & short stories, personal studies, research & non-fiction, poetry & spoken word, comic art & graphic novels, playwriting & screenwriting, text art & calligraphy, typography & asemic writing…
Enter Text is an international residency program for writers, researchers and artists working with text. The program brings together a diverse group of writers & artists who have different approaches to using text & language in their works.
At Arteles, residents are given the freedom to create and deepen their focus in a stress-free environment; They can share ideas and approaches, form collaborations, and gain fresh perspectives to their usual practice without the pressure of producing a finalized body of work.
Time and space at the residency can also be used for concentrating on ongoing work or research, starting a new project or pausing to contemplate their practice and being. Participation in group activities is voluntary, allowing residents to withdraw into their writer's chamber anytime they want.
Late autumn, darkness & sauna
Arteles is surrounded by forests, fields and lakes, providing artists a chance to center attention on their work in a peaceful, natural environment. Thanks to Finland's 'everyman's rights', the beautiful woods may also be explored freely.
In the fall, nature turns from multitone to monotone as it is getting ready for winter. Nature is quiet and snow may come & go as temperatures change unpredictably. Days are short and nights dark – ideal conditions for journeying into the mind and for getting together in our wood-burning sauna.
All residents are allocated private bedrooms with large working desks near a window. There is shared studio space available for more social or communal ways of working, as well as a hall reserved for scheduled meditation sessions (voluntary), yoga and silent being.

In our hyper-connective, digital everyday life and a (post-)pandemic era, opinions prosper in information bubbles, hermetically demarcated from each other, and so give rise to new social realities. The question of how a democratic community could be re-imagined and renegotiated is becoming urgent.
The statement by artist Adrienne Piper from the 1960s, 'The power of art is unlimited for social change' still carries weight today. But how can change succeed? How is it possible to break down unyielding points of view and create permeable spaces, in which collaboration can emerge, communities be formed, and paths of reciprocal learning be established?
Starting out from this question, Art in Public Space Tyrol 2022 will be dedicated to artistic social practices and thus operate in both rural and urban spaces - participatively, collaboratively, dialogically and sustainably. By incorporating local conditions, artistic fields of action should be created, in which collective interaction and togetherness are discussed, formulated and applied.
General information
Since 2008, the funding program Art in Public Space has been implemented in cooperation between the State of Tyrol and the Tiroler Künstler:innenschaft (Tyrolean Artists' Association), and financed by the State of Tyrol. For the year 2022, it is announced for the second time under a thematic focus defined by the Tiroler Künstler:innenschaft, intended to bracket its content while writing concepts and implementing the chosen projects. The aim of the funding is to promote contemporary art and cultural projects in public space, so making the discussion of current social issues accessible to a broad public and opening up a dialogue on cultural, social and political issues. Art in public space aims to trigger discussions and become an integral part in the development of fresh perspectives.
In this context there are no limits to the conceivable artistic formats: permanent sculptural art projects, temporary interventions as well as participatory, performative and dialogical formats in public rural and urban spaces may be supported. Special attention will be paid to project submissions that are site-specific and have inherently communicative formats. In order to reach the most diverse audience possible, the projects should represent a synergy between artistic practice and everyday culture. In this sense, the venues of the projects may be as diverse as the projects themselves, offering opportunities to make art experienceable beyond the boundaries of cultural institutions.
Formal criteria
•The call for proposals should serve as a starting point and bracketing of content for the project submitted.
•Projects must be realized in the Tyrol, in public rural or urban areas, and must address the specific conditions of the chosen location.
•It must be possible to implement the selected projects within the period March to November 2022.
•Following an award by the jury, the prerequisite for state funding is the submission of every possible necessary permission for the project's realization, as well as agreement from the authorities responsible for the location(s) of the project submitted.
•Excluded are: funding in retrospect or the acquisition of an already realized artwork, classical 'Art in Architecture' projects, publications that do not form part of a project, and events in public space like concerts or theatre productions with no link of content to the funding action.
Target group
The call for tenders is directed towards international artists, artist collectives, curators, art or artist societies working in the field of contemporary visual art.
Endowment
In 2022, the action Art in Public Space will be endowed with EUR 80,000 by the State of Tyrol. The amount of state funding for the projects recommended for implementation can, according to the recommendation of the jury, amount to 100% of the total eligible costs. 2 to 3 projects will be invited for realization from among the projects submitted.

5 designers and 5 artisans will work with different traditional materials and techniques from the Algarve region: cork, hammered copper, palm, terracotta pottery and tiles.
The residency will take place in the Loulé Criativo space and in the artisans' workshops, in the Algarve. At the end there will be an exhibition of the pieces in the Gama Lobo Palace in Loulé followed by one in Lisbon.
Context
Algarve has a long history strongly linked to the resources of the territory. With a rich landscape diversity (cork forests, dry fruit farms, mountains, streams and wetlands) that is responsible for profound cultural manifestations and traditions. The use of raw natural materials - cork, palm, clay and copper - continues to have a strong presence in various crafts, however modernity rejects many of these ancient customs. We believe it's important to celebrate this aspect of the Portuguese and Mediterranean culture.
We ask designers to re-imagine traditional techniques and the application of these materials to create sustainable and even regenerative products. Innovative design will not only add value by connecting these products to the contemporary market, but will also increase the self-esteem of crafts(wo)men, valuing their knowledge, providing new opportunities and inspiring a new generation of artisans and designers.
Who can apply
The Applied Arts from Nature Residency program is open to:
* Designers, architects with a strong interest in craftsmanship with
a hands-on approach to their practice
* Committed to solving problems using design thinking
* Interested in experimenting with and rethinking traditional techniques
in natural materials.
* Interested in understanding the history of the use of materials and
finding innovative interpretations for applications in contemporary society,
ensuring continuous exploration and the evolution of tacit knowledge
* Dedicated to sustainable design (social, environmental and economic)

With this renewed open call, we invite applications from artists and researchers working across the fields of environmental humanities with a special focus on pollution and experimental art and media.
OVEREXPOSED is part of a four-year research programme from Sonic Acts on the materiality of pollution and systemic and political issues related to the contamination of our environment. It is an opportunity for artists and researchers to expand their practice and develop new ideas and methodologies while being financially supported in their work. As it is still difficult for us to host residents physically, the programme accommodates 3 artists and researchers in a home-based residency scheduled to take place in November 2021.
About the residency
The residency enables artists and researchers to develop their practice around the core questions underlying the OVEREXPOSED programme – investigating pollution and its (unequal) effects on all things living and non-living. Previous residents, for example, have addressed overlapping ethnic and environmental struggles or looked at climate change and pollution in relation to different approaches to time. Using artistic research as an exploration of the connections between aesthetics, historical materiality and politics, the programme intends to create awareness about pollution and its interconnectedness on a planetary scale, stimulate thought and imagination about necessary steps and, of course, mobilise direct action.
Expectations
Residents are expected to present their research in three formats:
(1) As a text (between 4000 and 8000 words) to be published on one or more suitable Sonic Acts channels
(2) As a research journal that focuses on visual materials – field notes, photos, archival findings, etc. – to be published alongside the text
(3) As a public presentation, such as a lecture, concert or video screening, to be organised by Sonic Acts in collaboration with the resident
Duration & financial support
The residency lasts for one continuous month in November and each resident receives a total fee of €2.000 – this includes production costs during the residency.
Costs for public presentations as part of a Sonic Acts programme will be borne separately by Sonic Acts, while presentation dates will be arranged in consultation.
Applications
The OVEREXPOSED residency programme is intended for artists and researchers active in the fields of environmental, blue, animal and energy humanities, discard studies, disaster studies, waste colonialism, health care studies, postcolonial studies, geopolitics, media and experimental arts. Sonic Acts particularly welcomes applications from disabled, queer, non-binary and Black and Indigenous artists and researchers. There is no age limit for applicants and those younger than 35 years old are especially encouraged to apply. The programme is also open to collectives. Applications should include the following:
• Research proposal outlining the intended focus (max. 3000 characters – roughly one page)
• CV & portfolio, including contact information
• Biography
• Portrait photo
The (edited) biography and portrait photo will be used for the publication of selected residents on the Sonic Acts website.
Deadline
Applications should be submitted via Homerun in English before 1 September 2021. Please submit all your application documents as 1 PDF via Homerun.
Selected applicants will be notified by email by 30 September 2021 and the names of selected residents will be published at sonicacts.com. For more information, contact [email protected].","","","<div class=""field field--name-field-body field--type-entity-reference-revisions field--label-hidden field__items""><div class=field__item> <div class=""paragraph paragraph--type--text paragraph--view-mode--full""><div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-paragraph-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item""><p>Sonic Acts is proud to announce the continuation of the OVEREXPOSED residency programme.

The chosen Polish, Portuguese and Romanian artists will travel to Jersey and spend 6 weeks living and working in the Island from 17 January – 25 February 2022 staying in accommodation at ArtHouse Jersey’s headquarters on the beautiful north coast of the Island.
Large numbers of Poles, Portuguese and Romanians call Jersey home and ArtHouse Jersey is offering an opportunity for one artist from each country to learn about, research and explore the lived experience of their compatriots, creating a piece of work that celebrates the contribution each community makes to the Island.
ArtHouse Jersey is working closely with the Polish Cultural Institute, The Embassy of Portugal and the Romanian Cultural Institute in London and plan to hold an event in London after the residency.
Criteria and terms
ArtHouse is seeking artists of any discipline (conceptual, drawing, painting, sculpture, ceramics, printmaking, design, dance, digital, crafts, photography, literary, video, film making, music, multimedia, live, sound, multidisciplinary etc.). Each artist will create an inspiring piece of work to be gifted to ArtHouse Jersey. The artists will attend the opening of a showcase featuring their work that will take place over the last weekend of the residency. Artists must be confident that they will be able to create their work within the timeframes and with the materials budget detailed below.
For the final 2 weeks of their residency the selected artists will contribute to the briefing of a visiting street art muralist on the lived experience of the Portugueuse, Poles and Romanians in Jersey, introducing them to the communities and explaining what they have learnt from the experience. This transfer of knowledge will inform the muralist’s creation of a piece of work in a separate but connected project which also aims to celebrate the contribution each community makes to Jersey.

In the midst of a global scenario that is still looking for balance, AADK Spain continues working to facilitate spaces for creation and bring our resources closer to those who need time for reflection and experimentation within their artistic practice.
""Today, our doors remain open, and we feel strangely and strongly equipped with the experience gained during these odd times. We believe that all we have experienced during the periods of confinement and social distancing has deeply impacted our idea of what is essential and what is relevant. Without a doubt, these times have also affected our sensory perception: in a matter of a few months, we became aware of the relevance of some of our most forgotten senses. The loss of smell became an indicator of our state of health, the need for bodily contact reminded us about the fragility of our emotional ties.
Touching is essential to our lives — it is estimated that within a day we touch around 150 objects and surfaces. Our contact with other human bodies is significantly less frequent than that, but nevertheless essential for our well-being. Today, touching is a gesture that invites us to redefine: how do we touch our planet?, how do we connect with other living beings and with our peers?"" - The AADK Spain team
AADK invites you to think about touch in all its complexity, reflecting, for example, on what we call textures – in image or sound – as a type of information that comes from a tactile experience. AADK considers that, already immersed in this “new normality”, it is essential to reflect on the limitations that have been imposed on touch as well as on our continuous turn towards a virtual world. Re-discovering our tactile relationship with the world and reactivating our haptic perception – that set of non-visual sensations that an individual experiences to receive information – are the proposals of this call.
Open Call deadline: 15/08/2021
AADK Spain invites all artists and researchers who wish to work on the topics of body, territory and spatiality to participate in its Artistic Residency Program. For this call, priority (not exclusive) will be given proposals that work with the topic of the haptic/tactile through any creative discipline (dance, performance, visual arts, work with new media or any other duly justified approach). Both individual and collective proposals are eligible.
About AADK
AADK Spain understands residency programs as contextualized spaces where location models the practices and modifies both its participants and the local communities. Thus, our Artistic Residency is an interdisciplinary and socially committed program that offers its attendants a space for analysis and production. It aims to facilitate research in rural environments, highlighting the value of local knowledge as a means to re-think how these locations can position themselves in an era of massive urbanization through a social, historical and geographical perspective.
Throughout their stay, participants create a temporary community that shares experiences and processes, fostering debate and a transversal perspective of their projects. AADK Spain provides tutelage and curatorial follow-up as well as assistance in production and management of projects and Open Studios night on the last Saturday of each month. Additionally, participants are encouraged to keep in touch with us after their residency ends, so that AADK can promote their work in forthcoming exhibitions curated by our platform as well as in papers, conferences and/or publications.
The amount of participants varies every month, but reaches a maximum of six projects (including individual proposals or duos/collectives).
Duration
1-6 months with 2 months being the recommended minimum for the full development of a project. The residency period starts on the first day of the first month and ends on the 30th day of the last month.
Studio/Workspace
Centro Negra is the main building of AADK Spain. It serves both as working area and exhibition space. It is located on the slope of a mountain, being reachable only by foot, and stands at the foot of a Moorish castle from the twelfth century.Its architecture is an assembly of small poultry yards and ancient houses that fell into disuse at the beginning of the twentieth century. It still retains many stone walls and mountain ledges.
The current structure is made up of 6 different and interconnected spaces. Each of them is unique in its size and morphology, constituting a set of great versatility and capable of adapting to multiple purposes. Given the morphology of the building, closed workspaces are not possible. This challenge is an opportunity to be in touch with the creative processes of other participants.
The artists will have access to: accommodation, work space, access to common areas and outdoor space, basic technical equipment, support in production, mentoring and curatorial support, visibility of the artist in the communication channels of AADK Spain. Accommodation is a private room in a shared house or individual apartment.

We believe that all we have experienced during the periods of confinement and social distancing has deeply impacted our idea of what is essential and what is relevant. Without a doubt, these times have also affected our sensory perception: in a matter of a few months, we became aware of the relevance of some of our most forgotten senses. The loss of smell became an indicator of our state of health, the need for bodily contact reminded us about the fragility of our emotional ties.</em><br><br><em>Touching is essential to our lives — it is estimated that within a day we touch around 150 objects and surfaces. Our contact with other human bodies is significantly less frequent than that, but nevertheless essential for our well-being. Today, touching is a gesture that invites us to redefine: how do we touch our planet?, how do we connect with other living beings and with our peers?</em>"" - The AADK Spain team<br><br> AADK invites you to think about touch in all its complexity, reflecting, for example, on what we call textures – in image or sound – as a type of information that comes from a tactile experience. AADK considers that, already immersed in this “new normality”, it is essential to reflect on the limitations that have been imposed on touch as well as on our continuous turn towards a virtual world. Re-discovering our tactile relationship with the world and reactivating our haptic perception – that set of non-visual sensations that an individual experiences to receive information – are the proposals of this call.</p><p><strong>Open Call deadline: 15/08/2021</strong><br> AADK Spain invites all artists and researchers who wish to work on the topics of body, territory and spatiality to participate in its Artistic Residency Program. For this call, priority (not exclusive) will be given proposals that work with the topic of the haptic/tactile through any creative discipline (dance, performance, visual arts, work with new media or any other duly justified approach). Both individual and collective proposals are eligible.</p><p><strong>About AADK</strong><br> AADK Spain understands residency programs as contextualized spaces where location models the practices and modifies both its participants and the local communities.

– To enable artists a period of research, development and production.
– To reinforce links with production/public in a proposal of dialogue, contemporary thinking and creation for local public display (in process).
– To enable the exchange of ideas and practice.
Casa da Tia+Quintal is a platform for Creative Residencies – a multi-disciplinary exchange, that presents a time and space for meeting a new/real context to think and/or work. Taking much into account site-specific projects with the local community, students, and partners.
The invitation is extended to practitioners or students of all disciplines (including Visual-Installation/Sound Artists, Historians, Curators, Designers, Scientists, Architects, Writers and Culture Researchers) of all backgrounds and areas, interested in implementing special projects and development of work in a decentralized, but not desertified locale – village of Pernes, Portugal, Europe.
Pernes town hall belongs to Santarém Municipality in Portugal’s central region and is a rural area surrounded by the Alviela and Centeio rivers and the National Natural Reserves of Serra de Aire e Candeeiros and Paúl do Boquilobo. Pernes is 14.500Km2 and has a population of 1689, and encompasses the villages of Chã de Baixo, Outeiro de Fora, Moita and Póvoa das Mós. It reaches about 1:00 hour from Lisbon, Portugal’s capital, and 2:30 from Oporto.
With some roads, some ruins, squares, some centenary’s auditoriums, some wood processing factories and old hydroelectric plants, markets, bridges, library, a local ethnographic museum, schools, old and young people’s houses and landscapes with sound and, almost, silence, Pernes nature needs to be experienced/changed up close.

With »Solidarity is a verb,« the program strongly encourages practitioners to shape a continuous production of relation grounded on common differences. While projects can inhabit the web as a space to practice solidarity, this open call encourages in equal manner initiatives that unfold on a local or translocal dimension beyond the screen, whereby the interconnection between off- and online should be taken into account.
In multifarious ways and different economic and political circumstances, artists and cultural practitioners have imagined and shaped modes of connectivity and togetherness. Our present and future hinge on collective action and assumed interdependence between and beyond places, between and beyond humans. The restrained mobility and the prolonged state of stillness we are experiencing on a planetary scale provide the impetus to reconfigure and construct new alliances from below, thus moving away from financially viable networks shaped by the market. This open call foregrounds the relational quality of solidarity, its ability to articulate politics and construct collective agency as a necessity of now. New and existing artist collectives, practitioners across the fields of art, design, writing, and performing arts invested in collaborations and collective approaches are invited to submit proposals.
»Solidarity as a verb« is situated in the realm of doing and imagining. First, this understanding acknowledges that one cannot take for granted forms of relationality and pre-existing communities; we need to continously construct and sustain them. Solidarity as such is always intentional and process-oriented. Historically, solidarity embodied colonial attitudes, it has been idealized and limited to prerequisites of sameness and identification. Shifting from a shallow understanding of »global sisterhood,« feminist thinkers reclaimed solidarity as a continuous production of relation grounded on common differences and politics of location. »The most principled way to cross borders« (Chandra Mohanty), solidarity can account for significant similarities while intensifying encounters with contextual differences , have a political basis rather than strictly biological or national, remain attuned to one’s immediate locale while reaching outside. Lastly, solidarity as a verb entails a definition of solidarity as an inventive practice (David Featherstone) that can shape unexplored ways of relating and expand the boundaries of a community with whom we stand in solidarity. In times of severe state and military control, artists have circumvented limitations of resources and mobility and stretched their locality through heterogenous initiatives from residencies, festivals, and mail-art communication to publishing and editorial endeavors. In the spirit of such past initiatives, this open call encourages practitioners to imagine new ways of negotiating distance and proximity. While projects can inhabit the web as a space to practice solidarity, this open call encourages in equal manner initiatives that unfold beyond the screen, whereby the interconnection between off- and online should be taken into account.
Format: Proposals can involve analogue means and low-tech, physical gatherings where possible and safe. Projects do not need to be conceived from scratch; ongoing initiatives (such as existing associations, networks) are welcomed.
Grant: For this call, curator Anca Rujoiu and Radu Lesevschi from ARC Bucharest will select four project proposals whose creators are rewarded with a four-week residency and a 750-euro grant.

How can virtual reality tools and digitization contribute to developing artistic practices that question materiality and offer possible ways to shift the discourse into other dimensions like experience, visualization, imagination, sensory perception, atmosphere, or spirituality? How can artistic practices using virtual reality contribute to current political and social discourses? What is the potential of virtual reality within the art field?

The residency programme at the Woning Van Wassenhove is a partnership between Stichting Mevrouw Jules Dhondt-Dhaenens and the Lampens Estate. The two residencies will each allow one Europe-based candidate of any nationality to stay in the Woning Van Wassenhove for up to 4 consecutive weeks between September and December 2021. Since the Woning is a single-person heritage house, the emphasis is primarily on reflection and research, although production that respects the integrity of the house is possible.How applicants choose to take advantage of their stay in the Woning Van Wassenhove is open, so long as the occupation of the house, its locality and architectural identity, are put to productive use. The resident is expected to organize a public-facing output at the Woning Van Wassenhove or Museum Dhondt-Dhaenens, either at the end of their stay or later, showcasing aspects of their practice in relation to the residency. Both residencies include a travel grant and per diem, as well as a budget for the public-facing output. Funding for the FABA Artist Residency is generously provided by the FABA Foundation. The Art & Architecture Residency is generously supported by Axel Vervoordt Gallery and Puilaetco.The FABA Artist Residency provides a practitioner in any artistic visual field the time and space to reflect on and further their practice in the Woning Van Wassenhove. The FABA artist in residence will benefit from the support, communication and institutional network of Museum Dhondt-Dhaenens. In addition, the selected resident is asked, in consultation with Museum Dhondt-Dhaenens, to organise a public moment — talk, performance, publication, broadcast, presentation… — following the residency.

The program is open to both accomplished practitioners and up-and-coming candidates with a high potential for artistic growth. Applicants are evaluated on their practice as well as on the quality and pertinence of a residency project specifically written for their time at La Becque. The residency program will dedicate particular attention to projects exploring the interplay of nature, the environment and technology – notions which are more than ever intertwined and at the core of contemporary preoccupations. A purposefully broad playfield, this thematic nexus opens up very different yet similarly rewarding avenues of exploration – for example: documenting what and who makes up the “Anthropocene”; using technological tools to document and transcribe natural environments into artistic contexts; exploring new junctures at which technology becomes part of our natural environments, and vice versa.La Becque’s Principal Residency Program provides the opportunity for artists to live and work on the unique site in La Tour-de-Peilz for periods of three months or six months. Artists-in-residence are provided with a live-work apartment for the time of their stay. The apartments are specifically designed for their artist-in-residence use. Each apartment is 80sqm in size, with a fully equipped kitchen, own washer and dryer, separate bedroom and bathroom and a flexible main live-work space of approx. 40sqm, plus a terrace facing Lake Geneva.Depending on the needs outlined by their residency project, residents will be granted exclusive or shared use of additional studio space. Our studios are 30sqm in size with 3.70m ceiling height and offer ample natural daylight.

Faced with a situation as complex as it is urgent, the COAL Prize 2021 once again invites artists from around the world to mobilize and reveal a world still alive, to feel and experience the ecological balance of forests, to promote the diversity of beings and cultures that inhabit them, to revive their ancestral knowledge and give birth to new ones, to nourish the movements of resilience they inspire, and above all, to act with the protectors of nature.In just a few decades, the forest has become both symbol and focal point of the greed, environmental disasters and struggles that are shaking up the contemporary world in crisis. Thirteen million hectares of forests disappear every year, due to increasing agriculture, overgrazing, logging, and urbanization. Entire swathes of forest in the Amazon, Australia and sub-Saharan Africa are burning while others die standing as they suffer the effects of global warming, depriving wildlife of their natural habitats. Worldwide, people are fighting in defence of these reserves of life and culture and to use them as blueprints for future worlds yet to be built. As a source of income and means of subsistence, the forest is also home to many indigenous peoples who today wage war to the death to defend a different relationship with nature and the living. The “wood” is a political space, historically a refuge for libertarians and resistance fighters. The marginalised, the outcasts and the witches, cohabiting with wolves and the cursed, haunt the imagination of the forest. Whether as an object of fear or a haven of peace, the forest is a conduit for the multitude of knowledge and stories that bring us back to the confines of humanity.The 2021 COAL Prize invites artists from all over the world to reveal these woodland riches, to feel and experience the ecological balance of forests, to promote the diversity of beings and cultures that inhabit them, to revive their ancestral knowledge and give birth to new ones, to nourish the movements of resilience they inspire, to act with their protectors and to invent other ways of being together in the woods.The winner of the COAL Prize will be awarded 10,000 euros by the François Sommer Foundation and COAL. This sum is divided into a cash prize and a production aid for the artist residency offered by the Museum of Hunting and Nature at the Belval Domaine, property of the François Sommer Foundation.The François Sommer Foundation was founded in 1966 by François and Jacqueline Sommer, pioneers in the implementation of a humanist ecology. Faithful to the commitments of its founders, it works towards the respectful use of natural resources, for sharing the wealth of natural, artistic and cultural heritage and for the protection of biodiversity in which mankind find its proper place.The Belval estate is located in the commune of Belval-Bois-des-Dames, in the French Ardennes. It spans an enclosed forested area of nearly 1000 hectares and is traversed by meadows and 40 hectares of ponds. A veritable observatory of rural life and wildlife, each year it welcomes selected artists who contribute to the representation of their vision of Man’s relationship to his natural environment. A testament to the Foundation’s commitment in supporting contemporary artistic creation, the residency at the Belval estate contributes to the dissemination of the artists’ works to a wide audience. The combined knowledge of the scientific and educational teams of the Museum of Hunting and Nature and those of the Belval estate will also be available as a resource for the artists. Applicants will be judged on the following criteria: artistic value, relevance (understanding of the theme – FORESTS), originality (the ability to introduce new approaches, themes, and points of view), pedagogy (ability to get a message across and raise awareness), social and participative approaches (engagement, testimony, efficiency, societal dynamics), eco-design and feasibility.

As part of »The Intelligent Museum,« a variety of approaches to AI-powered digital art will be used to critically examine and explore the socially relevant topic of AI from a variety of perspectives.The open call addresses artists who, regardless of disciplines and genres, apply machine learning, especially Deep Learning, in an innovative way in their artistic practice. Special consideration will be given to submissions that experimentally test new possibilities of interaction between artwork and recipients through the use of Deep Learning. Artists who do not consider themselves to be proven experts in the field of AI are also explicitly invited to submit project proposals. As a result of the residency, an AI-supported artwork is to be created and produced during the residency.As part of the collaborative residency, residencies are planned at both institutions – the Deutsches Museum in Munich and Nuremberg, respectively, and ZKM | Karlsruhe. The residency will take place over a period from June to October 2021 and will be scheduled in a dialogue between the artists and the partner institutions. Each location will offer the fellows access to site-specific resources and opportunities. During the residency at the Deutsches Museum in Munich, the Kerschensteiner Kolleg will be available as accommodation. In this inspiring environment in close proximity to the exhibition, new ideas will be generated and further developed. Workshops, lectures and other events at the Deutsches Museum in Munich and the Nuremberg branch will enable an open exchange from which artists, curators and visitors will benefit. The guest residency at ZKM | Karlsruhe takes place at the Hertz-Lab. The Hertz-Lab offers artists of all genres - from visual arts to music - the opportunity to try out a variety of technologies in collaboration with scientists and developers. The Hertz-Lab focuses on artistic production and media technology research.Available on site by appointment are: Workshops (wood, metal, electrical), a dark projection room, set-up areas for installation prototypes, a green screen studio, a sound studio with multi-channel audio projection, and a volumetric capturing system. Fellows will have access throughout the project to a dedicated AI server at the Hertz-Lab, built to both outsource inference for edge computing devices and accelerate training of medium- to large-scale deep learning models. The machine features an EPYC 7502P server CPU and two A100 PCIe GPU cards.Scholarship recipients will receive a stipend. The stipend is 1,500€ per month and is limited to a maximum of 3 months. The duration of the residency will be agreed upon between the partner institutions and the fellows prior to the start of the residency. For the realization of the artistic project, a maximum of 2,000€ can be spent on necessary material costs after consultation. As a rule, the items purchased in this way remain the property of the fellowship provider.For travel to the residencies, the scholarship holders can be reimbursed for their travel expenses up to a maximum of 1,000€, taking into account the applicable travel expense laws.

The residency is scheduled for September to October 2021 and located in Heidelberg, Germany.Kalamari Klub is an international artists’ collective for the celebration of analogue photography. They believe in film, the fine art of darkroom printing and experimental processes. Since 2016, they have been promoting and supporting local and international artists through festivals, exhibitions, workshops and a residency programme. For this residency period, they are delighted to announce their newest collaboration with IsoQuant.IsoQuant is a Collaborative Research Centre (CRC) at the University of Heidelberg focusing on Isolated Quantum Systems and Universality in Extreme Conditions. Collaborative Research Centres are long-term research institutions in which researchers are tackling innovative, challenging and complex research questions within a cross-disciplinary research program. The scientific aim of the CRC IsoQuant is to explore and gain a better understanding of the question of why many physical quantum systems exhibit characteristic common properties despite fundamental differences in key parameters such as temperature, density, or field strength. The cross-disciplinary approach to this research question within the IsoQuant collaboration brings together theoretical and experimental physicists from different fields and allows for a broad bandwidth of experimental and theoretical methods to solve overarching issues in physics. In its current funding period, IsoQuant committed to build up a manyfold scientific outreach program, including a SciArtCollaboration with workshops, artist talks, organization of photo walks, and this artist residency.With the SciArt Residency programme, the aim is to initiate curiosity-driven engagement between artists, scientists and other members of the society, promoting a spirit of co-learning and equality while helping to communicate knowledge through cross-disciplinary collaboration. A central part of the residency will be the active cooperation and exchange with scientists of the field. Before the beginning of the residency, the selected artist is invited to give a short presentation about their previous projects and research interests in order to initiate a conversation between scientists working within the CRC and the artist. During the residency, contact persons within IsoQuant and Kalamari Klub will be available to support collaboration, and the artist will be given the opportunity to further develop their research project and focus on their work. It is important to note the programme’s approach as „open prospect“: the form, process and outcome of the residency are entirely up to the artist and their collaborators. Additional funding for an exhibition, talk, workshop or other forms of presentation of the work done during the residency is available.Key features included in the SciArt Residency:Access to fully equipped darkroom laboratory (black-and-white & colour photography)Network of scientists, physicists and artistsAccommodation (apartment) in Heidelberg for the duration of the residencyCoverage of travel costs to and from the residencyCoverage of material costs during the residencyArtist stipend of 700€ / monthThe application is open to all artists and photographers working with analogue and experimental photography, as well as all those who are working within science-influenced art and photography.

The 2021 North Louisiana Virtual Residency will occur from February 8th to April 2nd with up to 16 artists (8 pairs). This eight week online residency will provide the virtual space and rhythm for artists to come together as a community and collaborate in pairs on new work. RLCF and NCLAC are offering this because, in this time of uncertainty and upheaval, they are remembering that art has always allowed humanity to understand and explain both the inner and outer worlds, bringing to life realities in a tangible substance that can be shared, retold, and reinterpreted in unending ways.
The organisers desire to foster a communal and collaborative environment — a sharing of this experience between artists as they process this period of life in their art and in turn give voice and vision to all who experience the collective work. To do this they will utilize a closed Facebook group, full group Zoom huddles, smaller break-out huddles, and maintain a central resource page on the Ross Lynn website. It is expected that residents will spend at minimum 2 hours per week mostly consisting of the weekly Zoom huddle, coordinating with their resident partner, and thinking about the prompts.
Closed Facebook Group: They will create a Facebook Group specifically for the residents where they can share thoughts, WIP (work in progress) updates, and respond to prompts the residency assistants will provide. It will allow for the opportunity for a constant stream of conversation to be maintained throughout the residency as well as making it easier to share photos, videos, excerpts, and other digital friendly mediums.
Zoom Huddles: Every week all residents and at least one residency assistant will “huddle up” via Zoom. We will have two types of huddles during the duration of the residency, full group huddles and break-out huddles. Half of the huddles will be full group, with everyone together in one session to discuss and share perspectives with each other, led by prompts. The other half of the huddles will have residents going into break-out rooms for smaller group discussions. These small group settings help foster community formation. These meetings will be scheduled at the same time each week to help provide stability. The huddles themselves will have a balance of structure and flexibility to encourage dialog and discovery. Residency assistants will be included to listen to the participants, to record the huddles, offer input, introduce topics/thoughts as needed, and moderate the conversations to help insure supportive/creative life-giving words. These are not platforms for criticism nor debate but support and encouragement of one another and the creative process.
After the completion of the residency, the artist pairs will be tasked to continue working on their projects. Each pair will have 6 months to bring the project to a finished format that is ready for public exhibition. The organisers will ask for progress updates with the pairs every 2 months. In keeping with the virtual format of the residency itself, the exhibition will be fully online and viewable to anyone with internet access.
Artist talk series: Each resident pair will be provided the opportunity to be interviewed on their work and experience during the North Louisiana Virtual Residency. The interviews are then edited into short artist talks that are made publicly available after the residency. The series as a whole both shows the process and impact of the residency while also providing a resource for other artists to take inspiration from.

This eight week online residency will provide the virtual space and rhythm for artists to come together as a community and collaborate in pairs on new work. RLCF and NCLAC are offering this because, in this time of uncertainty and upheaval, they are remembering that art has always allowed humanity to understand and explain both the inner and outer worlds, bringing to life realities in a tangible substance that can be shared, retold, and reinterpreted in unending ways.</p><p>The organisers desire to foster a communal and collaborative environment — a sharing of this experience between artists as they process this period of life in their art and in turn give voice and vision to all who experience the collective work. To do this they will utilize a closed Facebook group, full group Zoom huddles, smaller break-out huddles, and maintain a central resource page on the Ross Lynn website. It is expected that residents will spend at minimum 2 hours per week mostly consisting of the weekly Zoom huddle, coordinating with their resident partner, and thinking about the prompts.</p><ul><li><u>Closed Facebook Group:</u> They will create a Facebook Group specifically for the residents where they can share thoughts, WIP (work in progress) updates, and respond to prompts the residency assistants will provide. It will allow for the opportunity for a constant stream of conversation to be maintained throughout the residency as well as making it easier to share photos, videos, excerpts, and other digital friendly mediums.</li><li><u>Zoom Huddles:</u> Every week all residents and at least one residency assistant will “huddle up” via Zoom. We will have two types of huddles during the duration of the residency, full group huddles and break-out huddles. Half of the huddles will be full group, with everyone together in one session to discuss and share perspectives with each other, led by prompts. The other half of the huddles will have residents going into break-out rooms for smaller group discussions. These small group settings help foster community formation. These meetings will be scheduled at the same time each week to help provide stability. The huddles themselves will have a balance of structure and flexibility to encourage dialog and discovery. Residency assistants will be included to listen to the participants, to record the huddles, offer input, introduce topics/thoughts as needed, and moderate the conversations to help insure supportive/creative life-giving words. These are not platforms for criticism nor debate but support and encouragement of one another and the creative process.</li></ul><p>After the completion of the residency, the artist pairs will be tasked to continue working on their projects. Each pair will have 6 months to bring the project to a finished format that is ready for public exhibition. The organisers will ask for progress updates with the pairs every 2 months. In keeping with the virtual format of the residency itself, the exhibition will be fully online and viewable to anyone with internet access.</p><ul><li><u>Artist talk series:</u> Each resident pair will be provided the opportunity to be interviewed on their work and experience during the North Louisiana Virtual Residency. The interviews are then edited into short artist talks that are made publicly available after the residency. The series as a whole both shows the process and impact of the residency while also providing a resource for other artists to take inspiration from.

Centered on the principles of explore, create, and exhibit, the residency program offers the use of a studio space in a historic building in Berlin and a base in Kreuzberg from which to explore and discover the creative side of the city.Taking part in a residency at GlogauAIR, 13 international artists, with diverse social and geographical backgrounds, will receive support, advice, and develop their work in a dynamic community of coexistence. At the same time, they will get to know a new culture and landscape, getting influences from Berlin, renowned for contemporary culture. During the residency each artist will live inside one of the GlogauAIR’s Studios, having the opportunity to not only completely immerse in its own creative process, but also share ideas and opinions with the other artists living there.There are 13 studios distributed over the top 3 floors of this historic Kreuzberg building from 1896. Each floor has a shared kitchen, shower, WC and WIFI. Basic expenses, including maintenance, gas, electricity, and internet, and utilities are included in the accommodation. The kitchens are fully equipped and the studios have a double sofa bed with bed linen, table, chairs, desk lamp / bed lamp, wardrobe and shelves. There is also a charming garden and a backyard for common use.Different activities and collaboration projects are organized in or by GlogauAIR, including artist talks, interviews, studio visits and interchange programs with other residences and institutions, as well as a welcome lunch to get introduced to GlogauAIR's community. The main activity and event is the GlogauAIR's Open Studios Exhibition, which will be held by artists at the end of every residency. This is a great opportunity to literally open the doors of what has been the burning centre of your 3 or 6 months intensive artistic production and experimentation, showcasing your project with direct contact to the local art scene and a dialog with Berlin’s art lovers and enthusiasts.

The open call is addressed to artists, collective and creatives from Italy and all over Europe to present artistic concepts based on emerging technologies (e.g. AI, Big Data, Blockchain, 5G, IoT), considering their applications and usability into an urban and social context (for example, projects aimed at finding medtech solutions for COVID19 or solutions to enhance an ecological transition).Nesta Italia firmly believes that the synergy between Science, Technology and the Arts can be a driving force for innovation and socioeconomic development, that it can widen the scope of the artistic practice, giving back to artists a pivotal role within the urban and social context. The Open Call ‘City of the future’ is a tool by which they want to enhance collaborations between usually separated areas of work, thus contributing to Turin’s and the Piedmont region’s development, transforming this territory into a hub for talents, skills, creativity and entrepreneurship. In order to promote an effective synergy between companies, research centers and cultural spaces, a series of local stakeholders are involved, engaged at national and international level in the contemporary art research, production as well as residency programmes.

For each call, the curator selects four project proposals, whose creators are rewarded with a four-week residency and 750 euros. All selected Web Residents are nominated for the production prize HASH by Solitude which will be awarded in 2022.Moving away from all-encompassing dystopian future scenarios, »Post-Doom« explores how the perception of a lost present is inscribed in and reproduced in our everyday experiential spaces. As a seductive counterpart to this seemingly hopeless approaching terminal state (or standstill), Hedva calls for us to rethink beginnings, new multiple entry points, and experiences that reveal the longing for a whole, unmediated potential of our present and future.Introduction from the curator: I started thinking about doom recently because I was explaining to a friend the difference between death metal and doom metal. »Death is fast, doom is slow,« I said. I realized that when we speak of death, it’s often scaled to the individual, but doom is always scaled hugely, collectively: »We are doomed,« »Earth is doomed,« etc. The twenty-first century is marked by doom – the climate crisis, the promise that this is »late« capitalism (if only!), that liberalism is dead or dying. In 2020 we’ve found ourselves weathering many kinds of doom – disease, fascism – the apocalypse is here. We’ve killed the earth; we keep killing ourselves.What comes after doom? And what does doom begin? How has it already mutated us? Think of Mark Fisher’s assertion that it’s easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism. Is this imagining now upon us? Or has it already been here for a while? What happens when we think of doom as a beginning, rather than an end? To start from the position that, of course we are doomed – so, now what? Or, does doom foreclose linearity at all? Is it always ongoing and happening everywhere, and if so, what does such a condition produce as a future, or as a past?One of the generative threads here is thinking through accessibility, which is particularly relevant in the present transformation COVID-19 has wrought on the world. Under ableism, disability is often called »a fate worse than death.« But for many, disability justice and crip theory are emancipatory politics, a means of abolishing the pernicious ideologies – from racism and colonial-imperialism, to homo- and transphobia – that form the bedrock of patriarchal capitalism, because ableism is at the heart of oppressions that are based on an invented hierarchy of superiority and normativity. This year, I’ve been interested in what I call »the blast radius of disability,« a term that describes the period of time that detonates around illness and disability, when perspectives of our individual selves and capacities mutate, as do our understandings of time and productivity, and our interdependencies with the systems in which we are entangled.Accessibility is a host for considerations of how we experience and participate in social life: it ranges from disability access (if a building is wheelchair accessible, if a video has subtitles), to concerns of who, and how, people can physically attend an event or place, which is to say, who is allowed and supported to appear in the political space of the public. There is an inherent value with which this presence/absence binary is bound, and accessibility asks after the political consequences of such value. It asks about anywhere, who is not here, and why. Integrating accessibility into work from the beginning, rather than thinking about it at the end, produces new and evocative layers of meaning, multiple entry points and experiences. It pushes against the notion that art is best experienced in person, within a designated space for art, especially germane to consider when applying to a Web Residency.Applicants should discuss accessibility in their proposals explicitly. For example, if a project contains an online component, applicants should explain how they plan to engage with the WCAG (web content accessibility guidelines). If work is predominantly audio, applicants should explain how they will ensure access for the Deaf and hard-of-hearing community.They invite artist, healers, astrologers, dancers, musicians, alchemists, writers, and everybody who is willing to explore notions of new beginnings to apply. What if doom is a beginning, rather than an end? And who has access to this new beginning? They accept text, performance, 3D objects, net sculptures and installations, web archives, apps, and any other experimental mediums. Selected projects should be carried out in open-source formats that are well-documented, shareable, and consider the accessibility of its users, who may range in age, race, gender, economic class, and ability.Deadline for applying is November 15, 2020.

Or has it already been here for a while? What happens when we think of doom as a beginning, rather than an end? To start from the position that, of course we are doomed – so, now what? Or, does doom foreclose linearity at all? Is it always ongoing and happening everywhere, and if so, what does such a condition produce as a future, or as a past?</em></p><p><em>One of the generative threads here is thinking through accessibility, which is particularly relevant in the present transformation COVID-19 has wrought on the world. Under ableism, disability is often called »a fate worse than death.« But for many, disability justice and crip theory are emancipatory politics, a means of abolishing the pernicious ideologies – from racism and colonial-imperialism, to homo- and transphobia – that form the bedrock of patriarchal capitalism, because ableism is at the heart of oppressions that are based on an invented hierarchy of superiority and normativity. This year, I’ve been interested in what I call »the blast radius of disability,« a term that describes the period of time that detonates around illness and disability, when perspectives of our individual selves and capacities mutate, as do our understandings of time and productivity, and our interdependencies with the systems in which we are entangled.</em></p><p><em>Accessibility is a host for considerations of how we experience and participate in social life: it ranges from disability access (if a building is wheelchair accessible, if a video has subtitles), to concerns of who, and how, people can physically attend an event or place, which is to say, who is allowed and supported to appear in the political space of the public. There is an inherent value with which this presence/absence binary is bound, and accessibility asks after the political consequences of such value. It asks about anywhere, who is not here, and why. Integrating accessibility into work from the beginning, rather than thinking about it at the end, produces new and evocative layers of meaning, multiple entry points and experiences. It pushes against the notion that art is best experienced in person, within a designated space for art, especially germane to consider when applying to a Web Residency.</em></p><p>Applicants should discuss accessibility in their proposals explicitly. For example, if a project contains an online component, applicants should explain how they plan to engage with the WCAG (web content accessibility guidelines). If work is predominantly audio, applicants should explain how they will ensure access for the Deaf and hard-of-hearing community.</p><p>They invite artist, healers, astrologers, dancers, musicians, alchemists, writers, and everybody who is willing to explore notions of new beginnings to apply. What if doom is a beginning, rather than an end? And who has access to this new beginning? They accept text, performance, 3D objects, net sculptures and installations, web archives, apps, and any other experimental mediums. Selected projects should be carried out in open-source formats that are well-documented, shareable, and consider the accessibility of its users, who may range in age, race, gender, economic class, and ability.</p><p>Deadline for applying is <strong>November 15, 2020</strong>. Submit your project proposal in the form of:</p><ul><li>a headline</li><li>a concept text in English (1,000–1,500 characters with spaces)</li><li>a header image (high resolution, landscape format)</li><li>a short bio in English (500 characters with spaces)</li><li>a portfolio PDF (images, text, links)</li></ul></div></div></div></div>"

Due to COVID19, the international mobility of artists is restrained and we are all facing major changes in our lives and way of working. AiNIN wants to give support to artists by sharing culture and creativity, bringing us closer even at a distance.They are calling for proposals for a virtual residency program on the theme of “Dynamic natural connections” to celebrate the germination of ideas, continual growth, and our inherent capacity for transformation and renewal. They look for generative, process-based art and research projects, rooted in nature as an open and evolving concept and encourage curiosity, exploration even from confined spaces and enhance connectivity among the participants. The programme is open to AiNIN members and everyone willing to join their association (the artist membership is €30 / annum) and it is curated to give artists the opportunity to present their works to a new audience through AiNIN social media channels, and networks.Applications are now sought from artists for two virtual residency programmes to be held between January and March 2021. During the three weeks of the residency, artists will be invited to share their progress weekly with the curatorial team and through their social media (website, FB and IG). A public presentation will be held at the end of each programme.Our way in Nature: As members of AiNIN we believe that art-in-nature implies respecting nature, revealing and commenting upon our relationship with our environment, rather than exploiting it for the sake of art. Our definition of `nature’ includes human and non-human animals; animate and inanimate beings; wild and untouched landscapes, rural, cultivated and agricultural spaces, some urban, suburban or city park environments and conservation reserves across a variety of public and private domains. Site-specific work in the environment and landscape can take many forms. However, paying attention to diverse geographical, cultural, historical, physical and elemental contexts of an environment is at the core of what AiNIN artists do. We are committed to re-envision a constructive, rather than deconstructive, approach to creating art-in-nature.Applicant Requirements:Artists, researchers, designers, scholars working in the field of contemporary art and research with a focus on nature.While any approach to nature is welcome they’ll select proposals encompassing a clear and coherent concept.Following an environmentally friendly principle, they ask for projects that utilise mainly materials found in-situ, recycled, natural, handmade or eco-friendly materials.Practices that cross-media and genres, materially and conceptually: object-making, sculptural installation, sound, performance, video, new technologies, text-based work, etc… are welcome to apply.Proposals that involve workshops and live demonstrations that aim to connect and inspire their members will be given priority.The applicant artists need to have a good internet connection to be able to manage online conversations.Basic video making skills and a good camera are preferable. If selected, you’ll be asked to participate in online meetings, shared studio sessions, and to make videos to document the process of your work.Project Support: 750€ for each project selected. For non-members of AiNIN, 30€ will be deducted from this amount as a membership fee.While they welcome group or collaborative projects the fee is meant for the project, not for the artist.The artist will be featured on the AiNIN website and social media.Deadline for applying is 15 November 2020. Applicants need to prepare the following materials and send to [email protected]:Completed application form and in one single PDF (max 15MB):A visual outline of your project’s idea (max 5 MB)Updated Portfolio (10 pages maximum, max 10 MB)Resumé with contact information, website and social media contacts (max 2 pages)","","","<div class=""field field--name-field-body field--type-entity-reference-revisions field--label-hidden field__items""><div class=field__item> <div class=""paragraph paragraph--type--text paragraph--view-mode--full""><div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-paragraph-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item""><p>Since 1999, AiNIN have been supporting artists and event organisers who create and engage in site-specific work in the environment across a broad range of disciplines.

This project aims to engage with vocabularies, languages, and narratives of resistance in order to build new forms of expressions against an epistemic violence of growing levels ingrained in our vocabularies.The project is built as a collaborative and multidisciplinary platform bringing together institutions, artists, grassroots organizations, and researchers for a multivalent dialogue between diverse life practices, stories, and voices to oppose cultural and social marginalization. The forms of communication and practices of European cultural institutions will be addressed through processes of questioning vocabularies, hegemonic narratives, and centric knowledge. The project will establish a map of sharing experiences, and a charter and podcasts for future vocabularies, inspired by counter-cultural activities opposing xenophobia, heteronormativity, and racism. This project is the result of a partnership between the Ujazdowski Castle Centre for Contemporary Art (Poland), the Inna Przestrzeń [Other Space] Foundation (Poland), Centre for Fine Arts Brussels (BOZAR) with the Africa Museum (Belgium), Kulturen in Bewegung (Austria). It is funded by the Creative Europe programme of the European Union.The Ujazdowski Castle Centre for Contemporary Art in Warsaw is devoting its long-standing residency programme to the above project. For the first time, in connection with the current pandemic, the residency can either be a monthly stay in Warsaw, Poland, or can be carried out online. There are two month-long residency slots available for artists, activists, academics, collectives, theorists, organisers and curators; people working at the interface of art, education and activism; people living anywhere in the world. This residency, which takes place at the onset of the project, will serve as findings shared and at specifying further artistic activities. It is a research-based residency, rather than being production-oriented, though the collaboration can be developed to an artwork commission where possible.This residency will support:practices based on various forms of expression, for example: performance, language, visual arts, body, video and audio, text, voice, literature and translation. These may function online and be based on encoding of new and decoding of existing content and formats. Special attention will be paid to works envisioned as intervention via the internet, not only the online representation of pre-existing forms.practices that recognise and counteract communicational oppression, those that celebrate creative forms of communication (not exclusively verbal), as well as communication resulting from the experiences of various environments that, in its online form, can reach beyond local networks of interaction and solidarity.The residency offers:fee of 1200 EUR;full accommodation in Warsaw, in the Ujazdowski Castle;up to €300 in travel expenses to and from Warsaw;an official invitation for visa purposes;free access to U–jazdowski’s exhibitons and programmes, including the November film programme accompanying the project entitled Decolonising the Screen;the dissemination of the resident’s work in written form or a podcast or a commissioned display as part of the project;where possible, admission to the programmes of the partner institutions in this project;curatorial and organisational support in research, connecting with the relevant milieus in Warsaw, as well as a readiness to discuss and look after the resident's work.From the participants it is expected:commitment to the topic of Smashing Wor(l)ds project and residency;presentation on the resident’s practices and contexts of activity at U–jazdowski;sharing of information and resources between the resident, the U–jazdowski staff, partners and audiences; an openness to the possibility of the participants of the process taking joint action;a written summary of the residency and/or a podcast (upon earlier agreement with the curators. If the resident participates in creating a podcast, separate funds will be allocated as necessary).Deadline for applying is 28 September 2020. Please send to [email protected] one PDF document (in English) with:a short biography (up to 200 words) as well as formal address and contact information, a website address or Facebook page as applicable;a short expression of interest statement (up to 500 words);your proposal of a topic for research and/or practices during the residency, and an indication of whether you propose to be present in Warsaw or not.The organisers do not wish to impose a predetermined form of presentation; they appreciate creative, narrative and innovative formats that will allow them to better understand your practice. A portfolio in PDF, a weblink, or a three-minute video or audio statement are also accepted. If the inability to communicate in English is the only obstacle to applying – please contact them to discuss whether other solutions are available.","","","<div class=""field field--name-field-body field--type-entity-reference-revisions field--label-hidden field__items""><div class=field__item> <div class=""paragraph paragraph--type--text paragraph--view-mode--full""><div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-paragraph-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item""><p>Ujazdowski Castle Centre for Contemporary Art invites to apply for the artistic residency within the project Smashing Wor(l)ds: Cultural Practices for re/Imagining &amp; un/Learning Vocabularies.

This is an exceptional year for the world. The spread of novel coronavirus caused a global pandemic and our society and lifestyle have been forced to change totally. In the beginning of 2020 – right before the pandemic, we had made a decision to take up the challenge of renewing the style of AIR and to give it a different perspective. I considered the trope of “moving”. The whole history of humankind could be traced through a concept of migration. Our ancestors have travelled for their survival, have struggled to adapt to different environments and have compromised their lifestyle each time. This accumulation of adaptations is called history. According to one theory, people from Africa reached Japan, the island of the eastern horizon, by long journeys after having tried multiple routes. The entire span of human migration has brought multifaceted changes tinting culture with many particular shades of experience. However, in the recent past (before the pandemic), we had developed a means to move quickly to distant places, whereas once we had to expend a stupendous amount of time to travel far. By developing a technology of efficiency, we have a lifestyle whereby everyone can travel as much as they wish – if their economic condition allows. I wanted to resist the current situation of today’s extreme globalization. Prior to the pandemic, we were thinking, is it really a good idea for artists to be moving from one place to another so instantaneously in order to meet the unknown, and to pursue our creative activities in disparate locations? Therefore, we decided to update the AIR program to have a version with no air flights: it is rather difficult to reach the residency. The three facets of the AIR experience are “movements, temporary stays and creative activities” and our focus was put on “movements”. However, due to the pandemic, any tedious explanation for the new program became unnecessary as of July 2020. The state of play now is that artists can barely even reach Japan. The concept for the new AIR has happened by itself due to the present circumstances, as it is currently not possible to actually travel long distances. (For me, this is an unexpected situation that is unfolding so fast.)In embracing the concept of “movement for survival” that is rooted in the depths of humanity and has accumulated meaning over a long period of time, these questions were raised: “What do we have now and what can we use? Can the movement of imagination, technology, and spirit be an alternative to the physical movement of artists? Is it possible to manage AIR without actually moving? What does moving mean anyway? What is waiting after having moved?” By listening to the ideas and suggestions of artists, we hope to turn this environment into an opportunity for collaboration and to discover the new structure of AIR together – although “it is rather difficult to reach places”. AIR is contingent on the existence of artists and it can be said that its structure was generated by their motivation for creative activities that pivots on a migratory energy. AIR will no longer be possible without artists regardless of the changing world. By investigating the core concept of “movement” with artists, we hope to find, by feeling out its processes and operations, answers which may be what humanity is seeking right now.Program outline: This AIR program consists of two different but linked phases.During the program period, regular online meetings will be held with the program director and the coordinator. In the “activity plan” of the application form, explain your theme, plan, research, artwork and project where Hokkaido and Sapporo are the landing points/temporary destinations of your movement, by responding to these points that we want to consider together: “What do we have now and what we can we use? Can the movement of imagination, technology, and spirit be an alternative to the physical movement of artists? Is it possible to manage AIR without actually moving? What does moving mean anyway? What is waiting after having moved?”. In addition, it is desirable that the “activity plan” is adaptable so as to be able to deal with the fact that things might abruptly change and other unknown circumstances might arise.* Since the pandemic immigration restrictions in Japan has been not undo. City of Sapporo follows the situation, and decide not to allow invited artists from abroad to enter Japan for the program.During the final presentation, the organisers would also like to present the submitted proposals to the public. Please indicate whether you give permission for this in the application form.Phase 1: Without using any flights, the moving starts from the residence (usual base) of the selected artists to SAPPORO TENJINYAMA ART STUDIO in Sapporo-city, Hokkaido, Japan. The artist has to share the information with SAPPORO TENJINYAMA ART STUDIO, such as a plan of 60-day moving (*Proposal plan: movement plan), a record of its process and artist’s experience on trial and error described in an artist’s original method (*Proposal plan: methods to record/share the activity).With the artist’s proposal, the reality of “actual movement” will be seriously examined at a meeting with the artist, a program director and coordinators based on the pandemic situation and restrictions on movement over countries/regions as of October 2020. The most important points to be considered are physical and mental health and safety of the artist, and preventing the infection of novel coronavirus through the movement of the artist.During phase 1 & 2, it is possible to use the artist’s studio, living area and other Artist in residence/studios located within the travel area, for the artist’s activities and production. Also Sapporo Tenjinyama Art Studio is happy to help to find those places for “Stay & Work ” with invited artists, if necessary. However, if the artist is self-isolating and using their home as a workplace, a budget for accommodation and studio won’t be provided. In the proposal plan: movement plan, we welcome external involvements: other people and organizations such as “artist in residence” and “art center” that are on the route of the artist’s movement and that support the artist’s temporary stay. Please describe in detail in the plan. Phase 2: After 60 days of “moving period”, there is 40 days of studio work (*Proposal plan: outline of production activities during the studio work period). While the selected artists communicate with other artists, namely the artists invited for other projects and the artists staying in SAPPORO TENJINYAMA ART STUDIO at the same time, the end result (* Proposal plan: form, direction and image of the end result) has to be prepared and presented at the end of the program period.Please assemble your proposal of studio work and end result on the assumption that the selected artist and the SAPPORO TENJINYAMA ART STUDIO may be working remotely.The process of studio work is recorded as much as possible, and after a consultation between the selected artists and the program director, we make this record public for a certain time and period.The program coordinator and a general coordinator, and if necessary, technical assistants (in Sapporo city or in the base city of selected artists) support the artist’s activities.The report of the end result is premised to show in public regardless of the format. They will select the best method which many people can experience and share the result.Applicants must:Have a nationality other than Japanese and live in a country other than Japan. (Foreign artists living in Japan and Japanese artists living overseas are not eligible.)Be able to communicate in either English or Japanese with a staff, colleague artists and the local community.Be able to concentrate on their research and the program activities for the full period of 100 days.Be able to understand and follow the aim of the International open call program and proceed with their autonomous activities during their stay.Preferably not have previously participated in an AIR program in Japan.There are no restrictions on age or gender.

Intended for performers of any instrument, the Sampo is an extension whose purpose is to widen the sound field of an acoustic instrument. It allows to deepen the musical expression in any place and in complete autonomy.
The purpose of the residency is to hold a concert for the creation of the works of the composers who won the 2021 Composition Contest for Acoustic Instruments and Sampo. The concert program will be composed of the creations as well as repertoire pieces chosen by the performer in collaboration with Musinfo. The concert will be fully performed with a Sampo. Working on Sampo requires no previous experience in the field of electroacoustic or mixed music. There will be two steps for the preparation for the concert:
First, a few months before the residency, a Sampo will be provided to the performer so that the concert can be prepared in the best possible conditions during the composition phase of the work. Sampo allows the networking and exchange of configurations sent by the composer and received on Sampo by WiFi.
Second, in order to allow a real exchange and improvement of the piece in a stimulating context, two performers and two composers will be hosted in Saint-Étienne from 2 to 7 May 2021, during the Art & Science Days. On this occasion, in addition to building relationships with other composers or performers, residents will be able to interact with the public, participate in a panel discussion on the use of Sampo, and attend the festival's various concerts and events.
The residency is open to performers of all ages and backgrounds. This residency is intended for solo performers. The selection of residents will be based on the cover letter and the recordings provided. The payment for the concert will be a €300 net fee. Residency dates: May 2 - 7, 2021 (to be confirmed during the call). Musinfo will provide:
a Sampo for the duration of the collaboration
initial training and support throughout the duration of the loan
the cost of meals, accommodation and transport within France. International travel expenses shall be covered by the residents

Tainan City Government has launched open calls for its Artist-In-Residence (AIR) program to select international and domestic artists to be placed in Tainan. For many artists, taking a residency is one method of exploring their art practice, while simultaneously discovering a different culture. Currently, there are two sites managed by the Tainan City Government, namely Siao-Long Cultural Park and Tsung-Yeh Arts and Cultural Center.International artists participating in Residence Program of Siao-Long Cultural Park and Tsung-Yeh Arts and Cultural Center live in a vibrant community of artists and have the opportunity to exchange techniques and ideas with other artists; local and international, emerging and established. Artists live in close proximity to local craftsmen artisans and are encouraged to take the community and vibrant local culture as inspiration for their art works. Two parks have professional wheelchair accessible and air-conditioned modern studio spaces, galleries and theatres for exhibitions, workshops and performances.AIR Theme for 2021:Siao-Long Cultural Park takes the concept of ‘Site-Specific Art’ as its theme for the AIR program in 2021. The artworks should respond to the park’s environment, including the warehouses, corridors, the railway landscape, the children’s museum, and either the indoor or the outdoor spaces. They should also engage with the locality’s natural and historical sites, and with local communities.Tsung-Yeh Arts and Cultural Center takes the concept of ‘Site-Specific Art’ as its theme for the AIR program in 2021. Artists shall create works before observing the following contexts: hydrology of Tseng-wen River (including river basin and water management system), physiography (archaeological studies, soil, meteorology, or topographical variations), ecology (aquatic, amphibian, and terrestrial fauna and flora in the area), humanities (indigenous, agricultural, river-related, or ecology-related culture).Artists working in the following disciplines are invited to apply: Interdisciplinary; Visual art; Performance and Photography (Siao-Long only). The application is online with deadline 11th September 2020. The residency covers:Living and working expenses in Taiwan (including personal income-tax and insurance) - partly subsidized (NT$ 30,000 per month maximum). The total amount will be paid in installments.

The ever-advancing digitalization of everyday life implies an intense overlapping and layering of familiar physical, but also finely interwoven digital spaces. LINZ FMR focuses on the shifts, distortions and rifts that arise in this process and presents current artistic positions in this context. The festival, whose title alludes to ephemerality and short-livedness, presents works whose initial ideas can be found in virtual and/or digital space or have a strong reference to it, but are shown (sometimes in a transformed way) in the physical surroundings of the city of Linz. The focus is primarily on the interstices that arise during these transformations into public space – outside of museums, galleries or art spaces. At the same time, LINZ FMR attempts to subject the concept of sculpture to a contemporary update and to reflect on questions of transience, ephemerality and obviousness.LINZ FMR 21 will be located on the premises and in the immediate vicinity of the Mühlkreisbahnhof, a small secondary railway station in Linz-Urfahr. The station, which is operated by the Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB), is the starting point of the Mühlkreisbahn, a branch line to Aigen-Schlägl, a town in the northernmost part of the province of Upper Austria near the Czech border. It is separated from the rest of the Austrian railway network and thus represents an island operation. This place combines numerous topics that are of interest both for the future development of the city as well as for the festival: #transition, #point of intersection, #interface, #mobility, #isolation, #hastiness, #transfer, #erosion. For the 2021 festival, LINZ FMR is taking up these topics among others, placing them at the centre of a contextual approach to the location and offering them for discussion from various perspectives.To deal with all these topics more intensively, LINZ FM[Ai]R 21 invites artists or art collectives to spend one month creating a new work, or further developing an existing project. Openness to the mission of LINZ FMR as outlined above and interest and readiness to work together with the team of LINZ FMR are naturally preconditions. During the residency, LINZ FMR will provide space, resources and facilities for productive experimentation, dialogue, and collaboration. The work developed during the residency will be presented within the framework of the festival in the form of a group exhibition, performance, or another mode of presentation, and complemented by discursive formats. The artist will also be given the option to be part of an artist talk.LINZ FMR is a joint project of the two independent Linz-based art and cultural initiatives qujOchÖ and servus.at, the Atelierhaus Salzamt of the City of Linz, the Art University of Linz and the Linz-based Sturm und Drang Gallery.The resdiency is with duration of 1 month and the possible periods are February and March 2021. Eligibility:Artists of any age, sex, gender, race or nationality can apply for a one-month residency in February or March 2021 (applicants can choose one of the two options or indicate that they are available for both). The curatorial board – a panel of members of the collaborating initiatives and institutions for LINZ FMR – will review the applications and select the successful candidates in one session.Successful candidates are expected to reside and work in Linz for one month. The work produced during the residency is expected to be shown in the exhibition in public space during LINZ FMR 21.The one-month residencies will take place in February and March 2021, the exhibition of LINZ FMR 21 will open on 1st June 2021. For the realization of more complex works, the artists presence and support during the days before the exhibition is expected (exact timing to be negotiated).The applicants should be able to speak English fluently and should be flexible in interacting and engaging in conversation with the local art community and the LINZ FMR team.The organisers encourage applications from women and artists who identify as LGBTIQ+, members of ethnic, racial, or cultural minority groups, or those from otherwise underrepresented backgrounds.The conditions artists can expect which are also set in the artist agreement are:800 Euros artist grant,up to 1.000 Euros production budget (reimbursement based on receipts/invoices),up to 450 Euros travel expenses (reimbursement based on receipts/invoices),free use of a studiofree accommodation in one of the flats of Atelierhaus Salzamt for your one month stay,free access to your hosts facilities and various workshops of the Art University,a professional presentation, exhibition and artist talk (optional) during the Festival LINZ FMR 21,curatorial support during the residency.The application deadline is 30th August 2020.

These funding opportunities will increase the visibility of over 1,000 Caribbean-based artists, creatives and cultural practitioners to global audiences, provide much needed financial support, and develop the creative skills of our artists. Now more than ever in light of COVID-19, it is critical to think about artists having an online presence, valuing the work of Caribbean artists, and enabling their growth.The Stay Home Artist Residency will provide opportunities for 24 cultural practitioners to be supported while safely remaining in their studios/work-spaces, each of whom will receive a $3,000 USD stipend to produce work over a two-month period. The residencies will run on a staggered basis from August through November 2020. The support offered by the Stay Home Residency grant is targeted specifically at cultural practitioners without a permanent work affiliation, or whose main or sole source of income is from their creative/artistic output. Artists will be selected from the English, French, Spanish and Dutch speaking Caribbean by an independent regional jury.Using this residency as an opportunity for the growth of their practice, the Stay Home residents will also share blog posts bi-monthly about the work they are doing. This blog will facilitate artists’ reflections on their process and practice while documenting the experience for both their benefit and that of the wider public. The blog will be hosted on the CATAPULT online platforms.The programme targets individuals exploring the critical key themes of culture, human rights, gender, LGBTQIA+, and climate justice which are so relevant to the region.

The property features rolling hills, mowed paths, meadows, densely wooded forests, wetlands with a few ponds of varying size and a seasonal stream. In addition to these ecosystems a variety of native plant species host habitats for birds, reptiles and amphibians. Frequent visitors include coyotes, deer and wild turkeys. The barn is home to cats, chickens, goats, horses, pigs and sheep. There is also a private residence on the property, which is not available for use by residents.

During the residency, the participants can also get involved in Rupert’s alternative education and public programmes, and attend talks, lectures and workshops by prominent local and international curators, artists and thinkers.Prospective residents are encouraged to specify whether their intended proposal is more research-based or oriented towards a production-based project, requiring particular materials or utilities. They should consider and indicate in their application the desired length of their residency dependent on how they would like to use their time. It is important that the resident is willing to immerse themselves in Vilnius’ and the region’s contemporary art field. Residents can apply with any project proposal exploring any subject. They also welcome residents to engage with Rupert’s public and alternative education programmes’ themes, although this is certainly not a requirement. In 2021, through public events, talks, seminars, workshops and institutional exchanges, Rupert’s programmes will explore what practices of ritual, magic and fantasy can mean for today’s artistic practice. The programmes will consider how they can be used to re-evaluate what we take to be natural and real, as philosopher Federico Campagna has suggested.Located in the picturesque area of Valakampiai in Vilnius and only a short distance from the city’s flourishing cultural center, Rupert is set by the river Neris and a small river beach, surrounded by peaceful fields and a forest. The three residency studios are located in a recently constructed building called Pakrantė, designed by award-winning Lithuanian architect, Audrius Ambrasas. Pakrantė was founded as an arts incubator and houses a number of creative industries. Each resident is provided with a studio space and mezzanine (approximately 52 sq m.) to be used as a production and research space during the residency. The studio is fully furnished and equipped with WiFi. The building also houses a reading room, conference room and a kitchen, all of which are open for residents’ use.Rupert supports the resident with a studio, utilities, curatorial support (a minimum of 2 studio visits or feedback sessions per month), provides administrative support and facilitates access to required contacts, tools, materials and information for research and production. All the residencies are FREE this application round thanks to support from the Lithuanian Council for Culture. The studios are provided by the creative industries hub Pakrantė. In most cases, applicants are responsible for covering personal (daily and travel) expenses. Rupert’s team will issue acceptance letters for successful residents and support their applications for external grants to cover travel, food, production and other costs. Thanks to a newly established partnership with the Goethe-Institut in Lithuania, this round additional support will be offered to a few Germany-based selected residents.Individual residencies can last from 1 to 3 months or longer in exceptional cases. Residents are asked to propose their preferred duration of stay and if accepted this can be negotiated according to studio availability and schedule. Artist collectives of up to 3-4 persons can apply to an individual residency spot. Residencies will take place between the 1st of January, 2021 — 30th of June, 2021.

Accessible to all sound and experimental musical practices of our time, the GMEA accompanies the emergence of new musical forms coming from written, improvised, instrumental, electroacoustic or electronic music. The GMEA welcomes musicians or ensembles for sessions to permit creation, recording, or research. The average duration is 5 days but it can be arranged according to projects. All during these residencies, artists can benefit from support and GMEA’s network (artists, professionals, resource), which could be helpful for the development of their project.
Particular attention will be given to projects that include an experimental process. Diversity in composition of teams will also be a determining factor.
The GMEA provides a workspace and a technical and administrative team available for the selected artists according to their needs. These residencies take place in the GMEA (studios and rehearsal room), or on the premises of the GMEA’s partners (Scène Nationale d’Albi, Maison de la Musique / Cap Découverte, Musée du Saut du Tarn, Ville d’Albi, Théâtre Le Colombier, Abbaye-école de Sorèze…).

These residencies are conceived within the framework of the long-term project Beyond Matter and will be hosted by either one of the three partner institutions: the ZKM | Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe, Tallinn Art Hall and Tirana Art Lab – Center for Contemporary Art. On-site, fellows are expected to develop an artistic production or a theoretical concept that builds on the core questions underlying the Beyond Matter project. How can virtual reality tools and digitisation contribute to the development of artistic practices that question materiality and offer possibilities to shift the discourse into other dimensions, such as experience, visualisation, imagination, sensory perception, atmosphere or spirituality? How can artistic practices using virtual reality contribute to current political and social discourses? What is the potential of virtual reality within the art field? And finally, how can virtual reality serve as a media basis for overcoming physicality and temporality in order to create something new based on today's possibilities? What can VR stand for? Virtual Reality, Variable Relations, Vertical Radiation, Valid Readings, Vaporous Restoration, or Visible Revision? With this residency we invite applicants to consider not only the multivalent applications of the latest representational systems, but also various ways to expand them. Future applications must be thought of as versatile as their fields of application are constituted. That is why the search is not for one answer, but for many solutions.This residency gives artists and theoreticians working in the field of contemporary art from the EU and Associated Countries an opportunity to live and work in Karlsruhe, Tallinn or Tirana for a period of two months. The organisers want to expressly point out that they invite to apply not only those working in the field of virtual media but also artists and theoreticians with various artistic and theoretical practices and outcomes. Priority will be given to project proposals developed in relation to and conversation with the local realities of each of the locations. Residents will have access to institutional infrastructures. By the end of their stay residents are expected to produce a statement presentation.Each location offers residents access to particular resources and opportunities for their two-month stay:ZKM | Hertz-Lab: workshops (wood, metal, electrical), a dark projection room, set-up areas for bigger installations, a green screen studio, a sound studio with multi-channel audio projection and a volumetric capturing system available by appointment.Tallinn Art Hall: institutional support to hold workshops, sessions and/or seminars related to the overall themes of the project and, in particular, on the challenges of the latest XR-Applications, networking opportunities, research support, support to travel regionally, space for workshops and seminars.Tirana Art Lab – Center for Contemporary Art: research and production of artworks engaging with the overall themes of the project and involving public space or interventions in public space related to the city of Tirana, and the use of Extended Reality Technologies.Each residency is fully funded and includes travel expenses, free accommodation, a stipend and coverage of production costs.

The particular form that each residency takes is developed collectively through discussion once the group comes together. At the start of the residency, group members are encouraged to share their reasons for applying and what they hope to get out of their time with PRAKSIS. Early in the residency each participant is expected to give a brief introduction to their practice. Self-led activity will be supplemented by collective activity including, but not limited to visits, meals, discussions and a series of public events that aim to further group research and practice while opening dialogues to wider publics.Residency 18: Perfection / Speculation proposes a multi-disciplinary investigation of the meanings and ethics of genetic technologies. This residency is informed by Adam Peacock’s Genetics Gym project, developed while he was Designer-in-Residence at London College of Fashion’s Fashion Space Gallery. Applications are invited from investigators whose focus is on the modifiable human body as a medium of expression, experimentation, research and social interaction. Artists, designers, scientists, writers, psychologists, programmers, film- and video-makers, anthropologists and others based in Oslo, across Norway or internationally, are all welcome to apply. They are looking for talented individuals with distinctive approaches to the residency topic, whatever their specialism. It is intended that the final selection will reflect the scientific as well as the social and cultural dimensions of the area in focus.Perfection / Speculation will connect with body cultures of the past, present and future. It is supported by a dynamic relationship between its two residency partners: the Vigeland Museum and queer live events co-ordinators Karmaklubb*. The project will revisit the work of Norwegian sculptor Gustav Vigeland (1869-1943) to investigate past and future constructions of gender, race, sexuality, age, body politics, and the notion of the ideal human. Building on Karmaklubb*’s agendas, it aims to probe the social and digital cultures arising from discussions and practices around genetics and the body, and to establish a hub within global conversations about future impacts of design technologies on our bodies. Perfection / Speculation will feature events developed with the residency partners, a multi-faceted approach to research and project development, and the possibility of a concluding public event showcasing diverse residency outcomes. Events will include a very nice post-talk party arranged by Karmaklubb*.The residency understands that this topic can be approached both as a hard science or as an expressive narrative; and so is looking for talented individuals with a distinctive approach to the topic. The output might be; experimental sounds, manipulated imagery, diagrammatic output, scientific research, cultural research/papers, creative writing, digital human body design, CGI, or a format still to be defined. Applications are welcomed from artists, as well as practitioners or theorists in other areas whose interests and experience are relevant to the residency’s theme. Selected residents will be part of a temporary community of between five and eight local and international participants. The residency will involve group activities, discussion and creative exchange around the residency theme, as well as time for independent working. Selection is based on applicants’ ability both to gain from, and contribute to, the activities of the month-long residency.

Seven applicants will be selected to spend 14 days at the artist residence of Fondazione Morra and Museum Hermann Nitsch, in the heart of Naples, exploring “the art of remembering.” The organisers are particularly interested in those applicants with a keen interest in voyaging, journeys, ports and waterways; as well as in ancient symbols, scripts and codes through mediums such as poetry, theatre, sound, mathematics and performance to apply.Artists will have the chance to explore the subject on their own, in a contemplative and inspiring environment, as well as collaborate and celebrate a meeting of the minds. As part of the program, artists will get to know Naples’ creative scenes – curated by Fondazione Morra, encounter some of the city’s personalities, and immerse in the waves of the city and the surrounding seas.Each artist will interrogate the subject of ""remembering"" immersing in The Rabbit Hole Method™, a process of inquiry that extracts and distills from contemporary artistic practises, philosophy, mysticism, mathematics and dance. It includes the teaching of Hazrat Inayat Khan, Farid Ud-Din Attar, Jorge Luis Borges, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Lewis Carroll, among others. The rabbit hole seeks to stimulate new ideas about the self and the other, and to challenge culturally constructed limits and borders. Under careful advisory from Georgetown University, and the MIT Senselab, the program bases its principles on deconstruction, and the reinvention of rituals and forms.

Valley of the Possible’s 2020 research program draws inspiration and hope from a phenomenon called Terra Preta (Black Earth): a discovery that gives rise to the likelihood of parts of the Amazon Rainforest being a carefully constructed environment instead of a pristine wilderness. The hypothesis posits that the abnormally black and fertile earth found scattered around was created by the patient persistence and techniques of Indigenous cultures to maintain the fertility of one of the most vulnerable and important ecosystems on earth. An example of thoughtful human planning and landscape design evolving throughout thousands of years. For the duration of the full six-week period, Valley of the Possible will organise a tailor-made program: with the first two weeks being immersive and guided, and the last four weeks predominantly self-guided. This program consists of various trips into the valley as well as surrounding areas and (Indigenous) communities, visiting examples of gardens, national parks and ecological reserves guided by biologists, farmers, chefs and specialists from local universities.It also features guest lectures and workshops by Indigenous seed keepers, wild food (edible plants and fungi) foragers, regenerative agriculture experts, philosophers, artists, Mapuche and Pehuenche leaders and community spokespeople. They will screen relevant documentaries about Mapuche, Pehuenche and Chilean culture, as well as supply a small library of relevant books. In addition to the program, they offer access and introductions to a broad network of art and science institutions and universities in Chile, Latin America and The Netherlands. After the immersive program period, there is time and freedom to deepen your practice, work on your own projects and to go on self-guided trips in the area.From the grounds of the accommodation, participants have direct access to hundreds of hectares of native forest, several hot springs, geysers, and the Rio Blanco, with mineral water that springs from the adjacent Sierra Nevada volcanic mountain range. Apart from the program and the self-guided trips, they ask (though do not demand) the participants to consider dedicating a few hours per week to the earth and community they will become part of. Participants are hosted in a mountain lodge on a small farm located on several hectares of privately owned land. The lodge provides five basic rooms (private or shared), with comfortable beds, linens and towels, small working desks and heating in each room. Bathrooms are shared. The lodge also offers a communal kitchen, living room with fireplace and a collection of books. A fogón (traditional Chilean communal fireplace), a café and sandwichería, stables, laundry room and a primitive barn are also part of the property.

Each room has a desk and there is a simple rustig barn with basic tools. Participants do have access to a communal livingroom and a café.Valley of the Possible does not seek specific outcomes.

The residency will be realized in 2020. Hyytiälä’s SMEAR II research forest makes electronic and pneumatic sounds. Multi-coloured leads and pipes crisscross among the tussocks and undergrowth of a Finnish commercial forest. Plexiglass measuring chambers sigh as they open and close in tree branches and on the forest floor. Measurements also go on all year round in the immense Siikaneva wetland area and Kuivajärvi lake. The area surrounding the station also features an old enchanting natural forest and clear-cutting area. Hyytiälä is a renowned base for international researchers who come to the station to conduct measurements and meet colleagues. The station is located in Juupajoki, Finland. It has been calculated that the measuring stations of the Centre of Excellence in Atmospheric Science measure at least 1,200 different items from the atmosphere, northern coniferous forest, swamps and lake. Research conducted at the station, scientific experiments and measuring campaigns help to answer complex research questions posed by natural sciences. Climate Whirl is an art programme functioning under the umbrella of the Institute for Atmospheric and Earth System Research (INAR) of the University of Helsinki, which began its operations in 2012. The programme realises artist residencies and commissioned works as well as art&science workshops. They are looking for an artist(s)-in-residence for the Climate Whirl programme to conduct their own research at the station. An artist or group of artists may work at the station from four to six weeks during 2020 depending on the needs of their project. The organisers aim to be flexible with regard to the duration and format of the residency; the most important thing when making the selection is the interest the proposal arouses and its topicality. They appreciate research oriented approach and long-term commitment. They hope that the artist-in-residence will leave something permanent at the station after the residency. It may be a work of art in the area surrounding the station, an experience shared with the audience that could possibly be recorded or an inclusive workshop after the residency period.The artist-in-residence will live in either a log building or the course centre with a shared kitchen and sanitary facilities.

The art-science residency The Persistence of Memory – Dementia and Digital Aid Tools for Decision-Making offers the unique opportunity for artists of all disciplines to exchange and workfor 6 months with researchers of the Institute of Biomedical Ethics and History of Medicine (IBME, UZH) in Zurich as well as medicines, researchers and patients at the Institute of Regenerative Medicine (IREM, UZH) in Schlieren and to develop an artistic project.The residency's unique setting opens up the possibility for a transdisciplinary dialogue that is brought about by juxtaposing concepts and procedures, cultural knowledge and backgroundsThe residency offers significant time and space to reflect upon ideas and to explore a range of scientific topics, methods and technologies in a broad field of medical disciplines and medical humanitiesDuring the residency the artist will be immersed in the research andworking alongside scientists from IBME and the IREMThere will also be a coordinator at both IBME and IREM available to the artist for more general issuesOn the subject of residency: Dementia is one of Switzerland's major social, cultural and health policy challenges. Today, 148,000 people with Alzheimer's disease or another form of dementia live in Switzerland. The ageing of the population will lead to a sharp increase in the number of people suffering from dementia in the coming decades. The experiences of other people with the same diagnoses, treatments or decisions have always been a valuable source of information for people facing a new diagnosis or a health-related decision. Digital media as sources of information create new opportunities and approaches to generate and harness knowledge, ideas and resources. Researchers at the Institute of Biomedical Ethics and History of Medicine (IBME) at the University of Zurich are investigating the possibilities and consequences of digitalization and other issues related to dementia. A current project at IBME is the Swiss database DIPEx for patient narratives, which will serve as a basis for so-called digital decision-making aids in the future. The new database offers a systematic collection of interviews with female patients and to be made available to the public via video and/or audio sequences on the Internet in the near future. The patients' reflections on their everyday lives in connection with health and illness are collected in narrative interviews and made available via established methods of qualitative social research.At the Institute for Regenerative Medicine (IREM) – also part of the University of Zurich - the focus lies on “advancing molecular life sciences into next generation bio-inspired therapies at the interface of degeneration and regeneration with a major focus on the most relevant human diseases, including neuro-degeneration and cardiovascular disease.”In an exchange with researchers, doctors and patients, the artist will deal with the various aspects of the research and treatment as well as patient narratives. As a team member, he/she observes, thinks along, exchanges, questions and critically examines the contents of the research from the perspective of his/her own artistic practice and develops an artistic project from this.Basic research questions from IBME for the artists-in-labs residency “The Persistence of Memory”:How can patients’ and relatives’ narrations (available as video, audio and text in German, French an dItalian) best be used to support important decisions Alzheimer patients and their families have to make (e.g. regarding care at home vs. nursing home or the content of an advance directive)?How can we use digitalization and artificial intelligence to produce the most useful tools for patients, surrogate decision-makers and providers (e.g.by predicting treatment preferences at the end of life)?How can we use the narrative materials to inform policy makers and the broader public about issues that Alzheimer patients and their families encounter?How can we produce educational materials that foster empathy and understanding of Alzheimer patients (e.g.simulators)? Applications for this Residency are open for artists from all disciplines, from Switzerland and worldwide. The application may be written in German or English.

It has made it its task to counter demographic change with art and cultural offerings. Their goal is on the one hand to understand the luxury of emptiness as a potential creative space and to use it for art and culture, social innovation and a new good life. On the other hand, this offer should revitalize Kalbe as well as the entire Altmark region, enable people to move in and create perspectives for staying. They see themselves as a social sculpture. Everyone can get involved and help shape the artists' city. The overriding goal is therefore to awaken and promote the creative potential on site through art and cultural offerings, and to create spaces to realize this potential. They began their work with this concern in 2013, andreceived many awards for it and have already received support from renowned foundations such as the Federal Cultural Foundation, the Robert Bosch Foundation and the Swiss Drosos Foundation.7th International Summer Campus 2019: The core piece of their work is the annual summer campus: over 50 days students of all artistic directions (fine arts, literature, drama, music, film, photography, media art, performance, interdisciplinary projects) are invited to live and work in Kalbe. For the first time, the 7th International Summer Campus 2019 will be of a special kind: the Künstlerstadt Kalbe with its social and creative approaches understands itself in the Bauhaus tradition, which will celebrate its 100th anniversary in 2019. On this basis, the organizers would like to set a particularly clear sign for the cosmopolitanism and colorfulness of Saxony-Anhalt. Artists from the partner regions of Saxony-Anhalt (Mazovia Province in Poland and Centre-Val de Loire in France) are invited to come to Kalbe. All other nations are also very welcome. In accordance with this request, they hope that the scholarship holders of the summer campus will see themselves as participants in their social sculpture: in addition to working on their own projects (or in connection with them), they can interact with the city of Kalbe and its inhabitants through participative/interactive art actions or workshops, for example. In addition, the scholarship holders present the works they have created or brought with them to the public during weekly studio tours.For all scholarship holders accommodation and work rooms are available free of charge. Some of the workrooms have been unused for several years and are of importance for the history of the city, such as the former court building in Kalbe. They offer unusual and unique opportunities for artistic production. This is exactly what they call the ""luxury of emptiness"": the rooms offer up to 70 square meters of space for the development of one's own creativity and at the same time represent a profitable challenge. In contrast to the often uniform working spaces in university cities, the rooms in the artists' city are often still unformed, but this provides an atmospheric and stimulating working environment. Performance spaces for readings, concerts, performances or screenings are already available, as are a basic stock of working materials, tools and technical equipment; further enquiries from the scholarship holders can be made individually.For applicants living outside Germany, the organizers can pay a travel allowance. Furniture and crockery will be provided and cooking will take place in a large shared kitchen. Each scholarship holder will be provided with a local partner as contact person. A wide-ranging supporting program with idea workshops, cycle tours or joint intercultural dinners offers the opportunity to get to know the city, the countryside and its history and to contribute one's own visions for regional development. The organizers are in the process of applying for funding so that they can subsidize food, materials and travel costs for all students. At present, these costs have to be borne by the students themselves.Interested students and artists can apply until June 1st 2019. The applicants themselves choose the time and duration (two to four weeks) of their stay during the summer campus (22.07.-08.09.). Arrival + departure is only possible on Mondays, except at the end of the campus, where the scholarship holders leave on Sunday. The dates of arrival and departure must therefore be indicated on the application form.The required application documents include the completed application form, a curriculum vitae, a portfolio with a maximum of 10 proofs of work (no originals!) and a copy of the current certificate of enrolment and a letter of recommendation from a professor (if still a student). Applicants living in Germany send their application by post to the following address: Künstlerstadt Kalbe e.V.; Gerichtstraße 26A; 39624 Kalbe (Milde).

The Spatial Sound Institute welcomes applications by professionals from various disciplines that consider creation and research of sound vital to their personal development and professional practice. No prior experience of music production or work with spatial sound environments is strictly necessary.The programme offers broad possibilities for participants at any stage in their artistic or scientific career – from established authors up to those at the beginning of a deeper personal exploration of sound, as well as students. Co-operation and peer-education among participants of various origins, backgrounds and interests is an important source of inspiration for participants and vital dimension of the Artist Residency Programme.

To foster artistic dialog and interdisciplinary collaboration, knowledge of German or English is expected.To mark the 25th anniversary of the Künstlerhaus Schloss Balmoral applications are invited for the international residential fellowships for 2020 with the theme: KUR – Art of Travel: Mobility and travel have not only rapidly accelerated over the past few decades, but have also become increasingly more socially significant. The art world has also become extremely mobile. Artists’ residencies and travel fellowships have had a decisive influence on this trend. Exhibition spaces and studios exist all round the globe, with exhibitions and biennials taking place worldwide. Artists are constantly on the move. This means that creating art is currently closely associated with the various topoi of travel. With this year’s theme, the Künstlerhaus is shedding light on the one hand on mobility and travel as artistic praxis and on the other hand on artistic positions which deal thematically with these themes. The title of this year’s theme, ‘KUR – Art of Travel’ is an allusion to the history of the town of Bad Ems and its tradition as a fashionable and sophisticated spa (Kur) resort in the 19th Century. Even then, artists were among its international guests. Where more than a century ago the former Hotel Schloss Balmoral was host to visitors from around the world to this spa resort, the present Künstlerhaus has for 25 years now been welcoming international fine artists. On the occasion of the 25th anniversary, artists are invited to examine the significance of (artists’) travel in the context of the mobile art scene and current artistic production.Balmoral fellowships are residential fellowships; continuous presence is obligatory. The fellowships are endowed with 1,400 € a month. Two fellowships are awarded for the period of three months. Four fellowships are awarded for the period of nine months.

One emerging or mid-career artist will have the opportunity to live and work in the West Clare town of Ennistymon in Ireland for a period of 8 weeks over the summer (6th July – 31st August). This Artist in Residence (AiR) programme is fully funded by the Arts Council of Ireland.The Courthouse Gallery & Studios is a not-for-profit contemporary art gallery and artist studios located in the market town of Ennistymon in Co Clare (pop. 2,000). The area is famed for its natural beauty and includes the geological topography of the nearby Burren (a UNESCO Geopark), the Cliffs of Moher and its many beaches.

Thanks to the precious collaboration with Fondazione Sciola, Municipality of Nurri, Proloco di Nurri and Archeogeo this 2nd Art Residency in Nurri will include an Exhibition in the Monastery of Santa Rosa in Nurri, a Symposium during the Festival Sant’Arte in San Sperate, and a 2nd Exhibition in San Sperate curated by Fondazione Sciola.The theme of the Art Residency is ‘Su Bixinau’, Sardinian for ‘the neighbourhood’. The Bixinau has always been an important point of aggregation and socialization: women used to sit and talk to their neighbors, entertaining themselves in manual work such as sewing, knitting, etc. ; the streets pullulate of the voices of children playing, while the men held conversations among themselves. Not even 60 years ago every neighborhood was composed of more than 20 large families with even up to 10 children. The Bixinau, the street, was a strong meeting point in which people socialize. Today, where youth have left to study and work in urban centres, many houses are empty, but each day, the elderly sit on benches to visit and chat. The character of the Residency is transdisciplinary and it is open to artists, researchers, writers or everyone who wish to be integrated in an unique place where is still possible to appreciate authentic aspects, questioning themself about the Genius Loci, a Latin term used to describe the particular essence or spirit of a place (which is also an investigation in the work of IVYnode).If your art practice embraces community interaction or collaboration in some way, temporary public art or site specific installation, sustainability or other models of art as social practice, this is the residency for you. The artists participating in the Art Residency in Nurri will have a unique opportunity to be part of the Symposium “Su Bixinau” during the Festival Sant’Arte, guests for 3 days of the Fondazione Sciola, to exhibit their work first in the Monastery of Santa Rosa in Nurri and then in San Sperate during a 2nd exhibiticion cureted by Fondazione Sciola.During the residency the artists will live in private houses in the village of Nurri. Each house is independent and provide bathroom and a kitchen. The houses are located inside the village of Nurri and it would be easier to live in contact with the habitants and feeling the authenticity of the place getting the chance to know as well artisans who still preserve an ancient knowledge of old techniques that are risking to disappear.The program includes:3 days in San Sperate during Sant’Arte Festival and accommodation in shared dormitory at Scuola degli Scalpellini, guests of the Fondazione SciolaSymposium “Su Bixinau” during Sant’Arte Festival3 weeks in Nurri, accommodation in shared rooms in private housesExhibition in the Monastery of Santa Rosa in NurriSecond exhibition in San Sperate end of June or July (to be decided yet)The organization does its best to support projects, providing guidance in acquiring materials, seeking information, making connections within the community. IVYnode is a non-profit network and tries to keep the fee and expenses of the participants at the minimum. The fee is 850€ and covers the cost of accommodation and the use of the studio. Artists must cover the cost of their own art supplies, food and transportation and to contribute to gas costs if they need to go somewhere by car. Cooking and cleaning are also the responsibilities of the artists.

This residency is open to emerging, mid-career and established artists, giving them the opportunity to step away from the day-to-day hustle and focus on a new or existing project in an inspiring setting. Ajo is a quiet, little-known town in the heart of Arizona's Sonoran Desert, ideal for a period of creativity and experimentation, as well as exploration. The community is full of artists of all kinds and embraces visiting artists from across the country and around the globe. For Spring 2019, there is no prescribed theme or medium. They are focusing on visual and performing artists, and preference is given to Native and Latin individuals to highlight the historic (and historically underrepresented) populations of this region. That said, artists of all backgrounds and cultures are encouraged to apply. They are now accepting applications for 4-week residencies in May 2019.Visiting artists are given a kitchenette room at the Sonoran Desert Inn for the duration of their stay. The rooms, all former elementary school classrooms, are comfortable, air conditioned, spacious, and full of light. The kitchenette, stocked with a coffeemaker (and locally roasted coffee), fridge, microwave, stove, pots, pans, and dishes, allows artists to easily prepare their own simple meals. All rooms are on the ground level and open onto a lovely central courtyard, the centerpiece of which is an urban farm managed by their partners, the Ajo Center for Sustainable Agriculture. ADA-friendly rooms are available. While other guests will be staying at the inn during the residency, they intentionally host artists-in-residence during the quiet months. Expect javelinas, bright night skies, and conversations with locals and travelers. Don't expect a courtyard full of people or a packed roster of events.Visiting artists will also be provided, at no cost, a large, air conditioned classroom as their studio space. Classrooms are approximately 800 square feet and have five 8-foot windows, letting in lots of natural light. They are equipped with an artist sink; hi-speed WiFi; cabinets, closets and shelving for storage of supplies; and tables and chairs (which can be removed if not needed). Studios are ADA-friendly, with ADA-accessible restrooms nearby. They have rehearsal and performance space available, as well as outdoor work spaces for artists wishing to work en plein air. While they welcome visual and performing artists working in any medium to apply, there are some limitations to the work space and available equipment.The Sonoran Arts Residency provides time and space to explore Ajo and the surrounding region, and get to know the locals and fellow artists. It isn’t strictly a retreat-style residency, where you will work in isolation for days at a time - although by expanding it from 2 weeks in Fall 2018/Winter 2019 to 4 weeks in Spring 2019, visiting artists should be able to balance focused work time and community exploration. The organizers envision the residency as a chance for artists-in-residence to contribute to the growing arts community in Ajo, so they will ask each visiting artist to participate in community activities to showcase their work. This generally takes shape as a pop-up show in a local gallery near the end of your residency, and open studio times throughout.Please review the FAQ, then click here to access the application. There is no application fee.

This theme was chosen to create and explore the connections between environmentally informed works of art and a city's community. From simple inquiries, such as who has access to information about the environment, to deeper socio-economic concerns— who can afford to be sustainable— they invite artists to respond to environmental questions while in residence at the SVAD studio. ​The organizers believe that the 21st century artist works with multiple and varied materials, including film/video/new media, installation, and performance. They would like to see applications from artists who have new perspectives and creative approaches to relevant concepts and pending issues in environmental or ecological studies and the oftentimes tumultuous relationships between humans and the earth. By asking artists to challenge those relationships through visual means, a goal of this residency is to inspire dialogue between artist, artwork, and community. While there is no strict definition to environmental or ecological art, it was spearheaded in the 1960s by artists like Joseph Beuys who worked with natural materials, and has continued to capture the public imagination in the years since through large outdoor works such as Robert Smithson’s Spiral Jetty (1970), Christo and Jean-Claude’s Surrounded Islands (1980-1983), and Olafur Eliasson’s Ice Watch (2014). Over the years, artists have taken critical standpoints in investigating human responsibility and the earth’s fragility. How will the current generation of artists approach and deal with environmental problems that appear increasingly unrepairable? What kinds of connections can art form between humans and the environment?South Carolina boasts national forests, marshes, estuaries, coastal wetlands, meadows, and rivers that are essential to North America’s ecosystems. Currently, the greatest threat posed within the state is new development that destroys natural habitats and drives indigenous animal species away. Although South Carolina is threatened by long droughts, it is also expected to experience longer and more intense periods of rain which will flood rivers and streams and threaten crops. The Gill Creek Watershed is the main watershed flowing through the city, although unfortunately it is an impaired system due to overgrowth of bacteria and low levels of oxygen in the water. The residency site is located along a smaller stream known as Kinsler Creek which, along with the Saluda and Broad Rivers, feeds into the Congaree River. While at Stormwater, the organizers hope the resident artist is able to be informed by Columbia’s environment and create work with Columbia in mind.​The Spring 2019 session lasts from March 1st– April 14th, 2019. SVAD is unable to pay for travel or housing for the resident at this time. ​The selected artist will be awarded a $1,500.00 honorarium.The studio is located inside of Stormwater Studios, SVAD’s artist studio is a climate controlled, 220 sq. ft. space with 24/7 access. It includes basic studio furniture --- a sink, flip table, chairs, easel, and drafting stool, with access to restrooms and a basic kitchen. The space includes a projector, high speed computer, receiver, and speakers. The artist may not live in the studio during the session. Requirements: Public art component: The artist should propose an artwork that may qualify as public art. The work may be created and installed in a public space, or be participatory and engage the public. Community Engagement: The artist should propose an activity to engage with the community at the School of Visual Art and Design. This may include a presentation, workshop, critique, or other activity. SVAD currently enrolls around 700 students in the areas of studio art, media arts, art history, and art education. The artist should also participate in a monthly open studio event held on the third Thursday of the month from 5:00pm-9:00pm. Thematic: The artist's work during the residency should be informed by Columbia’s ecology or environment. The artist should agree to exhibit this work toward the end of the residency. ​​The Artist Residency Program is open to all artists from around the world. Small collaborative groups are eligible to apply. The SVAD at the University of South Carolina is not responsible for arranging travel, food, or housing for the artist.​ To apply please submit the following as a single PDF attachment (under 10 MB) to [email protected], with deadline 15th January 2019:A one to two-page resumeAn artist statement (1 page maximum)A 300 word proposal for the artist residency: please address plans for your time here.

ARIEL (Author in International Residence in Lorraine) has set up a yearly program (autumn semester) of associated author for a period of 3 to 4 months between Université de Lorraine (host institution), and more specifically UFR ALL-Nancy (School of Arts and Modern Languages) and IUT (University Institute of Technology) Nancy-Charlemagne, and a foreign author. ARIEL would ideally alternate between an English-speaking writer (every two years) and a non-English-speaking writer whose writing language is taught at Université de Lorraine and likely to be translated by the students and the academic staff (i.e. German, Spanish, Italian, Russian and Arabic).ARIEL relies on the knowledge and know-how of Université de Lorraine (in particular in the fields of Arts, Literature and Languages, Information and Communication and Book Trade & Publishing) to participate in the dissemination of international culture in eastern France and the whole country through the publication of a French translation of the author’s text by a French publishing house and the implementation of various projects around the author's presence for students, pupils and the wider public.The writer's residence is based in Nancy. However, it also aims at the whole of the Lorraine territory, with interventions (in 2018-2019) in Meuse (Bar-le-Duc), in the Vosges (St-Dié and Epinal) and in Moselle (Metz and Fameck).

They are looking for contemporary practitioners that will demonstrate a genuine interest in the social context of Athens and who can engage with it critically by challenging social norms and taboos. They are looking for creative practitioners who will be open to collaborate, work with other artists and curators. Snehta candidates should demonstrate an interest in the local community of Kypseli or more widely towards other communities based in the city. The organizers are interested in artists who are driven by a research-based and explorative approach, and who will engage playfully and creatively with the city. The project is research based and work made from this research can be shown in a group exhibition during their residency period.

There is an artist fee of 840 Euro per month plus a 100 Euro deposit. The fee covers also guidance and one-to-one support for the facilitation of each project, including the acquisition of various resources requested whether technical or otherwise. Artists must engage in a dialogue with the Snehta team to request assistance. Access to a wood workshop and a dark room. The organizers supply each artist with a tailored toolkit, which include sites of possible interest, maps, art supply shops and useful contacts. Resident artists are encouraged to have an open-studio and/ or an artist led talk event at the interim stage of their residency. The progress and work produced by each artist will be promoted on the residency website and social media platforms (Facebook/Instagram) and through their e-newsletter.

Laterna Magika, which brings together multi-genre theatre performances and film projections on several screens on the stage, was first conceived as Czechoslovakia’s representative cultural promotional for the Expo 58 international exhibition. Its extraordinary success gave rise to an eponymous series of performances and subsequently a permanent theatre stage based on the same production principle. Due to its experimental nature, the combination of several media, the merging of fine arts and newly developed (especially projection) technologies, and finally collaborations with many remarkable personalities, it became a unique phenomenon in the context of both Czech and international art.The residency call closely relates to the innovative interdisciplinary research project Laterna magika. Past and Present, Documentation, Preservation and Presentation, which is supported by the Ministry of Culture of Czech Republic. The principal partner of the project, which will run from 2016 to 2019, is the National Film Archive in collaboration with the Faculty of Arts of Charles University in Prague, the CESNET university association, and the Czech Technical University in Prague. The project is comprised of historical research, preservation and digitization of historical film material, and the development of new multimedia data (motion capture dancing sessions, 3D modelling of stage design).There are three positions available in the Artists-in-Residence programme:research-oriented residency (February – April 2019) – 1 position (the artist is expected to conduct extensive research, his/her artwork reflecting on the work of Laterna Magika will be created after the residency stay in MF)production-oriented residency (August – September 2019) – 2 positions (the artist is expected to create an artwork reflecting on the work of Laterna magika during the residency stay in MF)The creative result of the artist residency should reflect on the cultural phenomenon of Laterna Magika in the form of an artwork that will be exhibited as part of a larger exhibition project dedicated to the legacy of Laterna Magika. The exhibition will run from September 27th until November 10th 2019. It will be curated by film historian Lucie Česálková and film theorist Kateřina Svatoňová.During their stay in MeetFactory, the artists will be provided with:accommodation (shared flat),a studio in MeetFactory,per diem 500 EUR/month (before taxes), curatorial support and networking.

As a part of the Haute-Provence Geopark, the place is known for its significant geological sites, as well for its changing and rugged landscapes, resulting from the geological uprising of the Alps. These lands are sparsely populated and reveal marks of an agricultural and pastoral life, strongly vivid in the past. The region’s history has been influenced by the surrounding mountains and the geological heritage is one of the most notable in Europe.The changing character of this land in between the plain and the mountain could represent a fruitful field of enquiry and artistic researches. The close collaboration with Gassendi Museum, hosting a surprising collection of natural history, ethnology and art, will offer a great opportunity to go deep in the research through a specific interdisciplinary approach.The residency program is directed towards professional artists who wish develop their research in resonance with the multiple aspects of the context around Digne; its geological and natural heritage as well as its history and current situation. The residency program will be the time and place for an outdoor exploration but also to work starting from the art and science collection of the Gassendi Museum and the archive of the Alexandra David Neel’s house. There is no obligation of producing artworks but the artist is requested to present in public his/her research during or at the end of the residency (conference, performance, lecture) and a workshop with school or students from the Digne-les-Bains art academy.The residency will take place between November 2018 and May 2019, during 6 weeks, that could be split in two or more periods. Once set, according to the artist and the Cairn art centre, the planned dates have to be respected. During the period of residency the artist will have a house located in Saint Benoit park, in the heart of the Geopark. Immersed in the woods, but not too far from the town, the environment is perfect for concentration, working and discovering all the natural sites around. An equipped studio is available for the artist in Gassendi museum spaces. The artist can use a E-bike for local displacement. The artist in residence is supported by the art centre team and will have the possibility to meet scientists and specialists of many fields to increase their research.The selected artist will receive a grant of 5000 euros including the fees, travel costs, per diem, and the cost of research.

What can it tell us about the age it was constituted and reorganised? How can this information make us think about current matters? Can an artist shed light on what of past ages remains in the present and rethink what history has crystallised, acting as a motor of shared consciousness?Arteco is glad to present a cycle of artist residencies aimed at drawing attention to archives and inert collections in Italy, acknowledging how the visual languages of contemporary art can reinterpret and re-enact narratives, so as to conceive new forms of critical thinking not only about the recognition of the value art-historical heritage has today, and the role principal cultural institutions play, but also about contemporary themes. Within the project present_continuous – winner of the grant project funder35 2016 – is a call for two residencies/research grants for contemporary artists aimed at studying a collection of prints from the Biblioteca Nazionale Universitaria in Turin.Between 1860 and 1890 Turin experienced a thriving historical phase, parallelled by a political reorganisation, in which four city institutions – the Accademia Albertina, the Biblioteca Nazionale Universitaria, the Galleria Sabauda (Regia Galleria) and the Biblioteca Reale – seemed to be joined by the same interest in giving relevance to their prints collections: at the time, prime movers not only in education, but also in the knowledge of old masters. Among the key players in this history is connoisseur Giovanni Volpato, who reorganised the collections in the Biblioteca Nazionale and the Albertina, creating albums which can be defined as actual atlases made up of prints cut out, pasted and juxtaposed. Some of these albums – thematically ordered by French school and Flemish school – would be the starting point for studies devoted to creating ever-changing connections.The artist and/or collective is therefore required to renew the perception of the archive and the collections in storage as slumbering spaces, helping create short circuits, prompt debates and give voice to the social and cultural emergencies of our time.Requirements:This call is addressed to Italian and foreign artists and/or collectives aged under 40, who work in all fields of the visual arts and contemporary research, with no restrictions of technique or medium.The artist and/or collective will be called for a 3-month residency, of which at least 30 days spent in Turin, to be considered not consecutive but overall including research period, production, exhibition mounting and dismounting, between October 2018 and April 2019 (dates to be defined).The candidates are kindly asked to submit a proposal outlining the specific research interests relevant to the residency.Attend the training course devoted to studying the prints collection (5 days in autumn 2018 with curators and professionals in the field).Be available for a series of talks and similar activities open to the public aimed at presenting one’s work (introductory meeting, studio visit and project debate).Produce at least one site-specific work as a presentation piece of the residency period, which will be showcased in spring 2019 at a public event (a talk, a workshop, a screening, a conference or an exhibition).Authorise the dissemination of images and texts for communication material and a publication connected to the public event.Each of the afore-mentioned activities will be overseen and supported (technical, research and production assistance) by Arteco team.Each selected artist and/or collective will receive a research grant of € 4,000 (gross, including VAT) thus divided:€ 2,000 to cover the costs of travels, training period, activities required and research.Up to € 1,000 to cover the making of works.Up to € 1,000 to cover insurance and accommodation expenses.The research grant payment is issued 50% during the stay of the artist and/or collective (production and accommodation costs) and 50% at the end of the residency period.

New-media artists from all over the world, inspired by the Greek natural landscape, come together to create a multicultural and cross-media ‘dialogue’ culminating in a collective presentation both locally and in Athens at the end of the residency.This year they celebrate the tenth anniversary of the residency. They are also partners in the pan-European “Interfaces” Project which is co-funded by the Creative Europe programme of the European Union and so the theme for this years residency is INTERFACES. What is an interface? When is an instrument an interface/an interface an instrument? How does the structure of an interface determine the structure of the art it is used to produce? When is a performer an interface? Can a whole performance be an interface? Themes such as these will be explored. Therefore they invite applications from artists who design, build and/or employ new interfaces or pre-existing interfaces in innovative ways, and performers who are excited by the prospect of working with new interfaces, or becoming one! As always Medea Electronique is committed to the high quality documentation of the residency, and so those interested in creating innovative documentation are also invited to apply. Residents will have the opportunity to employ the interfaces as part of the content for the Rhizomes III soundwalk app, created in association with ZKM in Germany and the Onassis Culutral Centre Athens, dedicated to the landscape surrounding the residency site.Given the theme, they are looking for artists excited by the idea of collaborative artistic creation, grounded in an improvisatory spirit and practice. You are welcome to come to the residency with a new interface already built, or work on the design and creation during the residency (but note that there is a limited technical/industrial equipment on site, since the location is in in rural Greece!) Alternatively, you may be interested in employing interfaces in novel and creative ways. It is worth emphasizing that Koumaria’s focus is COLLECTIVE art creation. Individual should expect, and desire, substantive input from other residents, and be open to having their projects morph considerably during the course of the residency. While the final outputs may each have a primary organiser behind them, Koumaria is not the place for the development and presentation of solo works/content.Please visit their website to find documentation of past residency projects. Your letter of application MUST reference past projects and demonstrate how you see your own art practices related to the range of artistic practices that have take place at Koumaria.The residency provides hospitality as follows:transportation from Athens to the residency and back.housing and food supplies during the course of the residencytransportation to all the sites visited as part of the residencyan additional stipend of 200 EurosThe accommodation is organized as follows:rooms & bathrooms at the residency are sharedcooking and cleaning the house during the stay is undertaken collectively according to a rota (organizing what tasks people are expected to do on what day)Access to technology:residents should bring their own equipment (instruments & computers etc.)the residency takes place in a remote region of Greece, with limited ability to obtain tech/electronic materials – it is far easier to get in the area a bail of wire, or a piece of pipe then a semi-conductor or an obscure battery!

This call is open to all physical or legal persons, living in Basque Autonomous Community, national or international. Three projects will be selected. The residency, which will last between four and twelve weeks, will offer space, context and time for the development of an artistic project, and it will take place either from February to June, or from September to December 2019.Open call for development of an artistic project in collaboration - The aim of this call is to offer the opportunity to an artist who lives in the Basque Autonomous Community to invite an artist or cultural agent who lives outside the Basque Autonomous Community, to a residency for the development of an artistic project in collaboration. The allocation of these residencies will be both for the development of projects and also to accommodate creative processes already in progress, in any format, regardless of the artistic discipline or the current phase of the project. The residency, which will last between four and eight weeks, will offer space, context and time for the carrying out of the artistic project. From all the proposals received, one project will be selected. The residencies will take place from February to June; or from September to December 2019.Open call for artistic research project - The aim of this international call is to support the development of artistic research projects that will be formalised with a three-month residency and the development of the programme of activities in Tabakalera throughout 2019. The residency and the programme of activities can be interspersed, if the resident considers it appropriate for the development of the project. It is a process that must be carried out in collaboration with the department responsible for developing Tabakalera’s public programmes. Thus, the public programme proposed will be part of Tabakalera’s programme of activities, in the form of symposiums, conferences, talks or workshops open to the public interested in taking part. During the 2018-2019 two-year period, by means of its programme, Tabakalera proposes as the epicentre the idea of exercise with the title Ariketak: la segunda respiración (Exercises: the second breathing). A notion that refers to all the procedures that aim towards improvement in each new action for those carrying them out. The Great Conversation congress functioned as the precursor to the project, gathering voices that came from critical theory, artistic practices, sports or pedagogy. The aim of this first activity focused on thinking about and discussing the ability of culture as a tool with the capacity for personal and collective transformation. Although the research residency must not specifically deal with the conceptual line, they will value the proposals that are susceptible of integrating, coexisting with or complementing any of the possibilities it fosters. This call is open to artists or cultural agents living in Basque Autonomous Community, as well as national and international. One project will be selected from all the proposals received.Open call for development of an audio-visual project - The aim of this call is to offer help to artists who are developing an audio-visual project within the practices of the contemporary field.

(Regional, national, other group affiliations)What concepts of ethnicity does the exhibition evoke? How are terms such as ‘(archaeological) culture’, ‘tribe’, ‘people’ and ‘nation’ used?Where and how do historical ruptures occur?

This is an interesting opportunity for a visual artist to develop their practice and make new works whilst immersed in a remote rural landscape and its community. The residency is based in converted stable buildings, part of Highgreen Estate, set in the sparsely-populated hill-farming area of Tarset in the North Tyne. Highgreen is remote with stunning views across the moors. There is an immediate community of about 15 people and the hamlet of Greenhaugh with an inn is about three miles away with the village hall at Lanehead about a mile beyond that. The local shops are in Bellingham, some 8 miles away and Newcastle is 40 miles away so the artist will need to have his/her own transport. Highgreen is made up of a collection of 18th Century buildings. Whilst the studio and site is generally on ground level with no steps, the buildings have access limitations. The artist’s flat is in part of a restored stable block and is accessed via a steep flight of stairs. The organizers realise this isn’t ideal and makes the residency unsuitable for artists who use wheelchairs or find stairs difficult to manage. You can see photos of the studio and living accommodation here.The total package, including free studio and living accommodation with broadband and utility bills paid, is worth £20,000. £7,200 fee is paid to the artist. The artist is responsible for their own personal costs eg materials, transport, food, access needs etc. The residency is supported by VARC staff and an appropriate mentor who will be able to visit the artist twice during the residency if it’s felt the artist will benefit from this. There will be an exhibition at the end of the residency that VARC staff will support. VARC will pay for presentation and refreshment costs and promote the event. VARC will produce an artist’s catalogue, 30 copies of which will be given to the artist.Selection criteria are:quality and strength of work,a history of exhibiting work and undertaking arts projects or residencies.conviction of benefit of the residency to the artist’s practice andcommitment to living at Highgreenexperience of, and enthusiasm for, working with peopleExpectations are that:the artist will live and work for the period at Highgreen; the artist will spend 20 days during the residency preparing and delivering an engagement programme with the public and with community groups (planned by VARC staff in consultation with the artist). This could include work with young people with special needs;the artist will produce a body of work for an end of residency exhibition held at Highgreen;because of the remoteness of the location the artist needs to have his/her own transport;the artist is expected to share their experience and process on social media; twitter, facebook and instagram; the artist will feed into an evaluation process.The deadline for applications is 16th April. Please use the website for submitting the application. Interviews of shortlisted artists will be held by skype or face to face as appropriate. These will take place in May.","","","<div class=""field field--name-field-body field--type-entity-reference-revisions field--label-hidden field__items""><div class=field__item> <div class=""paragraph paragraph--type--text paragraph--view-mode--full""><div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-paragraph-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item""><p>A <a href=https://www.curatorspace.com/opportunities/detail/ninemonth-paid-artist-residency-with-varc-visual-arts-in-rural-communities/2150 target=_blank>nine-month artist residency</a> with VARC (Visual Arts in Rural Communities) at Highgreen in remote rural Northumberland, September 2018 - June 2019.

There is an immediate community of about 15 people and the hamlet of Greenhaugh with an inn is about three miles away with the village hall at Lanehead about a mile beyond that. The local shops are in Bellingham, some 8 miles away and Newcastle is 40 miles away so the artist will need to have his/her own transport. </p><p>Highgreen is made up of a collection of 18th Century buildings. Whilst the studio and site is generally on ground level with no steps, the buildings have access limitations. The artist’s flat is in part of a restored stable block and is accessed via a steep flight of stairs. The organizers realise this isn’t ideal and makes the residency unsuitable for artists who use wheelchairs or find stairs difficult to manage. You can see photos of the studio and living accommodation <a href=https://varc.org.uk/news/nine-month-artist-residency-applications-welcome-now/ target=_blank>here</a>.</p><p>The total package, including free studio and living accommodation with broadband and utility bills paid, is worth £20,000. £7,200 fee is paid to the artist. The artist is responsible for their own personal costs eg materials, transport, food, access needs etc. The residency is supported by VARC staff and an appropriate mentor who will be able to visit the artist twice during the residency if it’s felt the artist will benefit from this. </p><p>There will be an exhibition at the end of the residency that VARC staff will support. VARC will pay for presentation and refreshment costs and promote the event. VARC will produce an artist’s catalogue, 30 copies of which will be given to the artist.</p><p>Selection criteria are:</p><ul><li>quality and strength of work,</li><li>a history of exhibiting work and undertaking arts projects or residencies.</li><li>conviction of benefit of the residency to the artist’s practice and</li><li>commitment to living at Highgreen</li><li>experience of, and enthusiasm for, working with people</li></ul><p>Expectations are that:</p><ul><li>the artist will live and work for the period at Highgreen; </li><li>the artist will spend 20 days during the residency preparing and delivering an engagement programme with the public and with community groups (planned by VARC staff in consultation with the artist). This could include work with young people with special needs;</li><li>the artist will produce a body of work for an end of residency exhibition held at Highgreen;</li><li>because of the remoteness of the location the artist needs to have his/her own transport;</li><li>the artist is expected to share their experience and process on social media; twitter, facebook and instagram; </li><li>the artist will feed into an evaluation process.</li></ul><p>The deadline for applications is <strong>16th April</strong>.

An experience about Time in the Oasi Zegna a residential module conceived for the second year for Cittadellarte-Fondazione Pistoletto and Fondazione Zegna by Andrea Caretto | Raffaella Spagna with the participation of two guests: Prof. PhD José D. Edelstein (Theoretical physicist, Department of Particle Physics, University of Santiago de Compostela) and Prof. PhD Marco Giardino (Geomorphologist, University of Turin). Residency period: 9th July – 16th July 2018.About the residency: The module offers an immersive experience in the territory of the Oasi Zegna, a protected mountain area extending for about 100 sq. km. in Piedmont, in the Biellese Alps, between Trivero and the Cervo Valley. Starting from an aesthetic experimentation based on a non-hierarchical ontology, according to which all subjects (living and non-living, plants, animals, rocks, objects, etc.) coexisting in that area are put on the same level, the participants will be involved in a wide-spectrum debate on the concept of Time. Through a series of field experiences led by experts from various disciplines, the selected artists will have the opportunity to experience first-hand some of the perceptive aspects of Time in a natural environment, through a comparison between the different temporalities characterising the natural systems: from the Deep Time attested by rocks and their transformation to the temporality of living beings (from the life span of a few minutes of some insects to the life span of hundreds or even thousands of years of trees), eventually questioning the concept of Time itself as a fundamental variable operated by physics in the last century.The 6 residency full grants will include:Participation to the residential module Expanded body #2 _ Inhabiting Time.

Water is in constant flow and yet may present itself as still - a mirror that mesmerizes. In this state its reflective surface invites gazing at our physical selves, but also beyond our bodies to contemplate both our inner experiences and relationships with the outer world. Water gushes from deep below earth’s crevices, falls from elevations and hovers in misty formations. It traverses time, shape-shifts as it slides through various spaces, and is one of earth’s greatest Sculptors. At once, water pours out of taps in developed countries as a banal occurrence, while women in developing countries trek miles to fetch it clean. Alarmingly, earth is under threat of losing all its sea ice this century, while future wars are predicted to be fought over water rather than oil. Yet, the world’s greatest religions say water holds the power to purify and renew.Once Upon Water will take place at Artscape Gibraltar Point on Toronto island, Canada. Due to record rains in 2017, forty percent of Toronto Island flooded and the islands were closed to the public. The waters have since receded and island life is once again thriving, but physical traces and stories of the flood remain.Residents work individually or collaboratively to create artworks that explore tangible and intangible concepts of water through media of their choice, such as photography, video, installation, drawing, painting, performance art, dance, sound art, media art, etc. Artists will have opportunities to socialize and integrate with people who live on, and visit, Toronto island. This programmed residency offers facilitation by multimedia artist Teresa Ascencao, a “water workshop” in movement arts, resident artist talks, a special guest artist talk, gallery tours in the city centre, creative and critical dialogue by the shoreline, and plenty of studio time. Critiques of residents’ works occur on a regular basis, individually with the facilitator and through facilitated group discussions. There will be a closing exhibition of artworks created during the residency (if preferred, artists may show in open studio fashion).The residency will host up to 20 professional artists. The cost is $1020 for shared accommodation or $1230 for private bedroom, plus HST. The fee includes sleeping quarters, large shared studio, facilitation, programming, and a closing exhibition. Artists are responsible for their travel to Toronto Island, their own food and art supplies. Artists are encouraged to apply for financial support through their federal, provincial and municipal arts councils, and other sources.

The programme provides 5-weeks-long residency in the city of Sofia to emerging curators. The residency covers accommodation, a fee and budget for the production of an exhibition or other curatorial project. Furthermore, the programme offers meetings with artists and curators in Sofia, studio visits, and assistance with research and production of final projects.The first edition of the programme takes place in the context of the Bulgarian Presidency of the Council of the EU during the first half of 2018. The political event of the Presidency is also an important impulse for the art scene.

This year, the program turns towards new directions, further embracing crafts and material-based practices. Onassis AiR seeks to enrich its artistic community by welcoming creatives working in fashion, design, and applied arts, navigating the potential of cross-disciplinary collaboration and co-existence within an environment of ongoing exploration.Onassis AiR Extended Research Residencies is a program of artistic residencies with a duration of three months. After the successful launch of the program last season, its second iteration expands its reach to a broader creative community that focuses on crafts. The program addresses artists, curators, artisans, performance artists, fashion and costume designers, writers, architects, set designers, filmmakers, sculptors, and other creative practitioners from any medium of expression or discipline, from anywhere in the world.In the 2024/25 season, Onassis AiR launched the Dramaturgy Fellowships, in collaboration with the Dramaturgy department of Onassis Stegi, aiming to support the research and development of new performance-based work.

The residency is designed for those who already have foundational professional knowledge in their field and wish to refine their technical skills in a dynamic and interdisciplinary creative environment. Selected participants will work closely with the highly skilled technical and production teams of Onassis Stegi and Onassis ONX and will be actively involved in the projects of Onassis AiR Fellows.All selected participants will receive an artist’s fee, the potential for a research/production budget, housing, travel to/from Athens, a collective budget for group site-visits and research trips, opportunities to engage with the art scene in Athens through networking events, and access to mentoring and audiovisual equipment.All program participants will be invited to participate in the Onassis AiR Open Days, a series of two-day public events held once per residency cycle.

Within the framework of the Fellowship Program for Art and Theory, the institution provides a platform that facilitates the development and production of artistic and art-theoretical projects in a critical context. At the same time, it provides a forum for direct exchange between professionals – artists, theorists, critics, and curators – from the region and abroad, as well as a point of interaction with local, interested audiences. Künstler:innenhaus Büchsenhausen is a section of the Künstler:innen Vereinigung Tirol, the main association of visual artists from the region.Büchsenhausen brings together two programs under one roof. On the one hand, it is the site of the Fellowship Program for Art and Theory. On the other hand, it is the location of several studios for artists based in Tyrol who are looking for a working space in a professionally interesting environment. Four apartment studios are used by the participants in the Fellowship Program. The other six studios are available to artists based in Tyrol. The project and presentation space is equipped with multimedia facilities and is at the fellows’ disposal.Fellowship ProgramWith its Fellowship Program for Art and Theory, Büchsenhausen promotes internationally relevant artistic production, research, and discussion in the region of Tyrol. The program is based on the idea of generating and maintaining a context for production and exchange, in which artists and theorists can connect and reflect on international art and societal discourses in relation to local topics and issues. At the same time, it provides the opportunity for an artistic laboratory of experimentation, where new artistic practices and strategies may be tried out.The program’s aims are:to promote and relay a critical, socially relevant production of knowledge in art and art theory;to produce, through the fellowship projects, qualified discourses on art and society within the local and global contexts;to enable the transfer of knowledge between the field of art and other public spheres outside the art context;to facilitate exchange between cultural producers in the visual arts and beyond (creating a network of experts).The program combines the advantages of a residency with the possibilities of a postgraduate, non-academic research and production fellowship on the basis of an open, non-formalized structure. Content-wise, the program addresses a worldwide public made up of professionals in the fields of contemporary art, architecture, art and media theory, as well as criticism.The Fellows are selected by a jury of experts following an open call for applications. They come to Büchsenhausen for a minimum of five months to work on the realization of their proposed undertaking and accompany this process with public events. For this purpose, Büchsenhausen assigns a monetary award and provides a production budget, a budget to facilitate the exchange with other experts and to (at least partially) cover the Fellows’ own travel costs, free access to the working space, free lodging, as well as artistic, art-theoretical, and technical advice.The conveyance and discussion of the Fellows’ own work occur parallel to the development of the individual proposals. The focus of the public events is determined by the respective emphases of the various Fellows’ works. Within the framework of these discursive formats, the Fellows and/or their guests can present various points in their investigations, open up their works-in-progress to critical discussion, interact with experts who they invite, work through content with the public, and/or try out new ways of working.The Fellowship Year starts with the Orientation Weeks in the beginning of January. The Orientation Weeks end with the Start Up Lectures. During the Focus Weeks in April, the Fellows and/or their guests publicly discuss issues related to their ongoing work, enjoy an intense exchange with their colleagues in the program, and carry out cooperation activities with other university and non-university partners and institutions. The Fellowship Year ends with a group exhibition curated by the artistic director of the Fellowship Program. The opening of the show will take place in June.In the past, Fellows occasionally collaborated with other artists/professionals based in the greater Innsbruck region. Cooperation activities have been carried out, among others with the University of Innsbruck (Institute for Comparative Literary Studies, Institute for Architectural Theory, the Research Group ‘Cultural Encounters—Cultural Conflicts’, the Research Center ‘Migration and Globalization’, Institute for Pedagogy etc.), the Working Group ‘Global Learning’ of Südwind Tyrol, etc. Künstler:innenhaus Büchsenhausen encourages the candidates for a fellowship to take the opportunity for a collaboration of such type into consideration.Information about former and current fellows’ projects in Büchsenhausen can be found here.Fellowship:a money award of EUR 5,000an individual studio for working and living, furnished with a large shared kitchena production budget for the realization of the submitted proposal;a budget for inviting experts to Büchsenhausen for the purpose of professional exchangea budget for (at least partially) covering the own travel costs (in relation to the Fellowship Program)the opportunity to present the produced work in a curated group exhibition at the end of the fellowshipFacilities:free access to the ‘Lab’, the project/gallery spacefree use of the available multimedia production equipment in the ‘Lab’free Highspeed-DSL/WLAN Internet accessprofessional artistic and art-theoretical advicetechnical advice if requiredRequirementsThe application must include a concrete work proposition.

The integration of artistic thinking and knowledge as reflective practices in their own right is an important dimension of the institute’s mission. For this the presence of art and the inspiration and challenge of artistic practice are essential. The interaction between these different perspectives creates a productive space for artists and scientists to collaborate in.For this reason, INHABIT invites artists to spend four months creating new work, or further developing an existing project, in a scientific research environment.

How might artists, wherever they come from, mobilise the local knowledge of individuals and communities from the Global South as they act in relation to climate crisis? How can they absorb and/or deploy globally interconnected knowledge and skills without reproducing the imperialist concepts and practices that underpinned colonial modernity?Applications are welcomed from local, national and international people with relevant interest and experience. The residency may be particularly relevant to cultural (or other) practitioners, performers, critics and researchers seeking to explore questions of artistic practice and environmental change in relation to local knowledge systems and movements. It aims to be a place of open exchange and sharing, in order to facilitate critical reflection on the geopolitics of environmental knowledge and the distribution of artistic resources addressing global issues.The group will collectively plan a residency schedule. The schedule will include daily group meetings and joint activities such as readings, discussions, visits to relevant spaces in Oslo, networking events, communal meals and socialising, alongside unstructured time for independent reflection and research. In the first week, residents will participate in PRAKSIS’s customary “Meet the Residents” event, informally introducing themselves and their practices to the rest of the group and the Oslo arts community.The residency provides:An active, facilitated programme connected with the residency topic.A communal work space at PRAKSIS, in the centre of Oslo.Comfortable shared accommodation (with your own bedroom) for non-Oslo based residents. Oslo-based residents will continue to stay at their local address.A stipend of 10,000 NOK for those who cannot participate otherwise. Limited stipends available, select this option in the application form.Weekly group dinners with invited guests. On weekdays, PRAKSIS will provide lunch at PRAKSIS HQ.Residents are responsible for their own travel and any further costs. The PRAXIS team is happy to support applications for external grants wherever possible.Requirements:English is the common language at PRAKSIS and residents must be sufficiently fluent to participate in group discussion and activity.Residents are expected to involve themselves fully in the work of the residency: joining discussions, participating in events and engaging with the resident community.Accepting a residency involves a commitment to participation for the full residency term.Submit the application via Google form by 5 January 2025 at 23:59 CET.

How might artists, wherever they come from, mobilise the local knowledge of individuals and communities from the Global South as they act in relation to climate crisis? How can they absorb and/or deploy globally interconnected knowledge and skills without reproducing the imperialist concepts and practices that underpinned colonial modernity?</p><p>Applications are welcomed from local, national and international people with relevant interest and experience. The residency may be particularly relevant to cultural (or other) practitioners, performers, critics and researchers seeking to explore questions of artistic practice and environmental change in relation to local knowledge systems and movements. It aims to be a place of open exchange and sharing, in order to facilitate critical reflection on the geopolitics of environmental knowledge and the distribution of artistic resources addressing global issues.</p><p>The group will collectively plan a residency schedule. The schedule will include daily group meetings and joint activities such as readings, discussions, visits to relevant spaces in Oslo, networking events, communal meals and socialising, alongside unstructured time for independent reflection and research. In the first week, residents will participate in PRAKSIS’s customary “Meet the Residents” event, informally introducing themselves and their practices to the rest of the group and the Oslo arts community.</p><p>The residency provides:</p><ul><li>An active, facilitated programme connected with the residency topic.</li><li>A communal work space at PRAKSIS, in the centre of Oslo.</li><li>Comfortable shared accommodation (with your own bedroom) for non-Oslo based residents. Oslo-based residents will continue to stay at their local address.</li><li>A stipend of 10,000 NOK for those who cannot participate otherwise. Limited stipends available, select this option in the application form.</li><li>Weekly group dinners with invited guests.

Sometimes it is not only an unknown other that is foreign to us, but also our own self. Friends can become strangers and vice versa. Surrounded by strangers in our everyday lives, we seek closeness and familiarity or withdraw. Forms of migration, from holiday trips to emigration, flight or expulsion, seem strange and unfamiliar to us, but they help us to perceive ourselves more clearly and thus understand ourselves better.Memory can play a major role here: memories of the often difficult partings in our own biography, of being on the road, which both unsettles us and gives us confidence. Or failing to cross borders, or overcoming them, the arrival in a foreign country with the desire to make it familiar. Where words may be lacking to describe such memories and experiences, art finds a language using signs, images, symbols, colour and structure.For the 31st International Studio Program, the City of Weimar and ACC Galerie invite artists to let stories of journeys, emigration and flight become visible and thus to make the search for refuge and future in foreign worlds aesthetically tangible. In this context, the International Studio Program would like to encourage artists to use not only the spaces of the ACC Galerie, but also the public space of Weimar. The city's archives, museums and libraries are at your disposal for your research in order to incorporate the genius loci into your artistic concept. Collaboration with Weimar citizens, students, young people, children and, last but not least, with those for whom Germany, Thuringia and Weimar are still foreign is also very welcome. (The title of this Open Call quotes from the poem ‘Good Night’ (orig. ‘Gute Nacht’) by Wilhelm Müller, set to music by Franz Schubert in his famous song cycle ‘Winter Journey’ (orig. ‘Winterreise’), op. 89, D 911).The non-profit organization ACC (Autonomous Cultural Center) originated in 1987, before the fall of the Berlin wall, when students occupied a derelict Renaissance building in the center of the town where Goethe had his first residence in Weimar. Shortly before the re-unification, ACC protagonists were able to secure the house with the aid of private sponsors. The institution now consists of a gallery and a café and offers a cultural program that includes music, literature and lecture series. Between spring 1989 and 2024 the ACC organized and curated more than 260 exhibitions (roughly four per year) of international contemporary art, through which the gallery has become a center for international cooperation and exchange. Simultaneously, the ACC focuses on the achievement of local artists and inaugurated an international artist-in-residence program. The current space is comprised of two connected buildings with 400 square meters of space consisting of 20 rooms in five former apartments.The City of Weimar pursues the following aims in its role as an initiator and partner of the International Studio Program: to combine financial support for artists with the presentation of contemporary art in the urban realm, to serve as a forum for artists and as a catalyst for encounter between them and to gain international recognition for the resulting activities. By these means, international cultural exchange is to be promoted and prejudices eliminated. The support provided includes the provision of a combination artist's studio/apartment in the Municipal Studio Building. The Studio Building is one of the oldest buildings of its kind in Germany. It contains 11 studios rented to different artists for limited time periods. The International Studio Program is supported by the State Chancellery of Thuringia.Located on the ground floor of the historical Municipal Studio Building, the studio is about a ten minute walk from the ACC Galerie Weimar in the town center. In addition to the visiting international artist, the well-lit studio building accommodates ten other artists. The studio (30 square meters/323 square feet) does not offer any other special equipment, such as photography, video, digital, etc. Rent-free, furnished apartment on the ground floor of the Municipal Studio Building with internet. Meals are available at ACC Café-Restaurant at a 30% discount.The monthly stipend is 1,100 euros. The ACC Galerie Weimar organizes the worldwide application procedure, convenes the independent jury, and supports the artists throughout the year. In order to receive the stipend the artists must live in Weimar during the work period. They must cover their own travel costs, although the program attempts to find additional funding in cooperation with the artists. Artists are expected to hold a lecture/talk at the ACC Galerie Weimar at the end of their stay. In addition we offer free entry to public municipal institutions, such as the City History Museum, and to the museums of the Weimar Classic Foundation, such as the Weimar Art Collection, the Goethe National Museum, the Bauhaus Museum, and the Duchess Anna Amalia Library. Participants are responsible for their own telephone bills and have to arrange for their own medical insurance.Artists from all over the world can apply. There is no age restriction. Students’ applications cannot be accepted. Project proposals must react to the outlined theme of our Open Call. The jury will select three artists, each of whom will spend four months living and working in Weimar.

Throughout the residency, together with the participating artists, the idea is to explore the tumultuous uninterrupted movements of translation that constitutes a complex and fundamental part of human interaction, transnational flows and connections.In the hundred years that have passed since Grimeton established Sweden’s first wireless communication channel across the Atlantic, the flow of information and people has exploded. We live today in a globalized age where exchange is an integral part of our everyday life and the larger geopolitical landscape. But what happens when language, matter and identities are transferred from one context to another? What is gained and what is lost when boundary lines are crossed? In every such transfer, different shifts occur – what we call translations. Various forms of transfers, negotiations and transformations take place here. In the residency In the wake of the waves we approach translation as a coherent but multifaceted field that opens up relationships between different forms of life and conditions as well as winding ramifications into new contexts characterized by plurality and creolization.Beneath Grimeton’s seemingly tranquil surface hides a long-life bursting with movement – not least all the stories that have traveled via the station’s long-distance waves. They form a bridge between the past, present and future. Grimeton becomes thus a vital springboard for excavations of historical and contemporary events that open up philosophical and existential reflections. About geopolitics, everyday life and everything in between.The residency In the wake of the waves explores the possibilities and limits of translation as well as its inconsistencies, dissonances and resistance. Based on a creative and open process, the participating artists will create new works of art during the spring of 2025 which, between June 14 and August 24, will be presented in and around the World Heritage Grimeton Radio Station.This call for applications is open to professionally active artists living in the neighboring Nordic countries Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark and Iceland.Residency and work production is carried out with the following schedule: on-site research in Grimeton/Varberg between February 10–21, independent work from home during the spring, on-site stay Grimeton/Varberg and finalizing production May 5–June 9 and installation June 10–14. The on-site stay during May and June can, if possible, be adapted to the artistic process in dialogue with selected artists.The artworks are presented in an exhibition and public program at the World Heritage Grimeton Radio Station and its surroundings between June 14–24 August, 2025.Each selected artist receives a fee of SEK 100,000 (excl. VAT, F-taxation, paid by invoice) which includes exhibition and participation compensation. If you apply as an artist duo, the joint fee amounts to SEK 130,000 (excl. VAT, F-taxation, paid by invoice). Art Inside Out offers an individual production budget of SEK 50,000 (excl. VAT) to each chosen artist. The same amount applies to artist duos. There is an additional budget for installation-related costs.Art Inside Out covers overheads such as travel, accommodation, work premises and process management.

Throughout the residency, together with the participating artists, the idea is to explore the tumultuous uninterrupted movements of translation that constitutes a complex and fundamental part of human interaction, transnational flows and connections.</p><p>In the hundred years that have passed since Grimeton established Sweden’s first wireless communication channel across the Atlantic, the flow of information and people has exploded. We live today in a globalized age where exchange is an integral part of our everyday life and the larger geopolitical landscape. But what happens when language, matter and identities are transferred from one context to another? What is gained and what is lost when boundary lines are crossed? In every such transfer, different shifts occur – what we call translations. Various forms of transfers, negotiations and transformations take place here. In the residency In the wake of the waves we approach translation as a coherent but multifaceted field that opens up relationships between different forms of life and conditions as well as winding ramifications into new contexts characterized by plurality and creolization.</p><p>Beneath Grimeton’s seemingly tranquil surface hides a long-life bursting with movement – not least all the stories that have traveled via the station’s long-distance waves. They form a bridge between the past, present and future. Grimeton becomes thus a vital springboard for excavations of historical and contemporary events that open up philosophical and existential reflections. About geopolitics, everyday life and everything in between.</p><p><a href=https://artinsideout.se/en/calls-for-applications/vagsvallet-en/ target=_blank>The residency </a>In the wake of the waves explores the possibilities and limits of translation as well as its inconsistencies, dissonances and resistance. Based on a creative and open process, the participating artists will create new works of art during the spring of 2025 which, between June 14 and August 24, will be presented in and around the World Heritage Grimeton Radio Station.</p><p><strong>This call for applications is open to professionally active artists living in the neighboring Nordic countries Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark and Iceland.</strong></p><p>Residency and work production is carried out with the following schedule: on-site research in Grimeton/Varberg between February 10–21, independent work from home during the spring, on-site stay Grimeton/Varberg and finalizing production May 5–June 9 and installation June 10–14. The on-site stay during May and June can, if possible, be adapted to the artistic process in dialogue with selected artists.</p><p>The artworks are presented in an exhibition and public program at the World Heritage Grimeton Radio Station and its surroundings between June 14–24 August, 2025.</p><p>Each selected artist receives a fee of SEK 100,000 (excl. VAT, F-taxation, paid by invoice) which includes exhibition and participation compensation. If you apply as an artist duo, the joint fee amounts to SEK 130,000 (excl. VAT, F-taxation, paid by invoice). Art Inside Out offers an individual production budget of SEK 50,000 (excl. VAT) to each chosen artist. The same amount applies to artist duos. There is an additional budget for installation-related costs.</p><p>Art Inside Out covers overheads such as travel, accommodation, work premises and process management. The artists are given the opportunity to work independently and/or together. During the research period of the residency, the artists are offered a program of meetings with local and invited guests, researchers and experts.

The idea is that people with disabilities are worth less or have fewer skills than non-disabled people.Post-colonialism: Until the end of the Second World War, European countries oppressed and exploited other countries around the world. The consequences of this colonialism are still visible today.Multiple discrimination: Many people are affected by discrimination in several ways. For example, women with disabilities.
