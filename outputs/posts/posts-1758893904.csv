After paying homage to Gérard Hourbette in the first year, this installation aims to make this public square both musical and creative, while showcasing young artists through annual calls for projects. Two versions of Le Bruit de l'air have already been produced.This year, as a tribute to Pierre Schaeffer on the 30th anniversary of his death, they are launching “Études de bruit 2025”.Artists are invited to design and create, with the help of their Computer Music Producer, a new sound geography for the paved square, freely inspired by Pierre Schaeffer's Cinq études de bruit (Five Studies of Noises).Pierre Schaeffer transformed our perception of sound by giving non-musical sounds the same importance as traditional musical sounds. His Cinq études de bruit, composed in 1948, illustrate this idea by integrating everyday sounds into a musical creation, opening up the field of possibilities for sound invention.They invite creators to re-imagine such studies today, in 2025, at a time when the notion of noise in music has taken on a whole new dimension. Noise has become not only a genre in its own right (Noise Music), but also an essential element of sound creation, not to mention the fact that the very nature of noise in our world has changed considerably over the last 75 years. For example, the material of Schaeffer's first study, the sound of trains, is not the same as it was in 1948. Similarly, kitchen utensils, such as the ‘saucers’ mentioned by Schaeffer, have acquired a more ‘chic’ connotation, thanks to the popularity of cooking shows and blogs, and turnstiles now generate different sounds.Composers, musicians, visual artists or any person working with sound, aged under 40 at the time the application is submitted, and of any nationality.Deadline for applications is Sunday, 30 March 2025 at 11.59pm. Documents to be submitted: ID, résumé, letter of motivation and a representative example of the applicant’s work in music and/or sound. Languages accepted: French, English.Format of submission: e-mail to the following address [email protected]. The one-week residency will be scheduled between May and September 2025. It covers €1,500 in royaltiesl; a one-week residency with a Computer Music Producer in their studios; coverage of transport costs between home and Art Zoyd Studios (up to a maximum of €300), accommodation costs and meals for the duration of the residency.","","","<div class=""field field--name-field-body field--type-entity-reference-revisions field--label-hidden field__items""><div class=field__item> <div class=""paragraph paragraph--type--text paragraph--view-mode--full""><div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-paragraph-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item""><p>Art Zoyd Studios, music creation and production centre based in Valenciennes, supports contemporary musical creation, with a specific focus on electronic and electro-acoustic aesthetics.</p><p>In collaboration with the MU collective, Art Zoyd Studios has created a sound installation, ‘Le Bruit de l'air’1 based on a geolocation interface, for the Parvis Gérard Hourbette2, opposite the Phénix, scène nationale de Valenciennes.

KUNSTRAUM is calling for submissions for our 2026 Artist-in-Residence Program.
KUNSTRAUM is a community of artists by artists with the goal of redefining the collaboration between artists and curators. Through our program, we aim to explore the relationships between artists and curators by opening our gallery spaces to those interested in exploring unconventional, engaging ideas and taking risks.
Our Artist-in-Residency program offers three-month residencies for national and international artists on a quarterly cycle. For 2026, we currently have open applications for January-March, April-June, July-September, and October-December.
All resident artists are invited to pursue their independent projects, interact with our established community of artists, designers, and filmmakers, interact with the incoming artists and curators of our ongoing exhibition program, participate in the monthly studio visits, and exhibit in the Annual Members’ show in the fall. To learn more about KUNSTRAUM, please visit our Website and Instagram account.
Each Residency Includes:
A desk-sized studio in our partitioned lofts with 24/7 access (no living). The semi-private studios inside the large open lofts range from 49 to 89 square feet.
Access to our gallery space (4-5 exhibitions a year) and participation in our Annual Members’ Show, including studio visit, professional documentation and programming event
Sales opportunities during the show plus via an online gallery for the duration of 6 months after
An artist community with 19 members and more than 100 alumni to meet and share with
Monthly studio visits by 1-2 New York and international curators, gallerists, critics, and art advisors (see “About” on website for the list)
Studio Visit with our Curator-in-Residence and monthly salons with artist community, social media promotion and a feature of your work on our website
Access to our internal monthly newsletter, which includes news, events, an open call list with exhibition, grant, and residency opportunities
Community events in which all resident and member artists are invited to attend. These community events vary and include gallery openings, curator walkthroughs, discussions, salons, and open studios.
The studio spaces have 24/7 access with 13 ft. ceilings, a freight elevator, slop sink, secure Wi-Fi, and are meant to be used for non-toxic materials only–all painters work on a non-toxic basis. Blick Art Supply, hardware stores, post office, print shops, supermarkets, restaurants, and delis are just 1.5 blocks away, and Home Depot is as close as 10 blocks.
No living is included. The resident artist is responsible for finding their own living and visa arrangements.

KUNSTRAUM is born out of a necessity to create community and foster collaboration between artists, architects, curators, designers, filmmakers, and writers.

Moons, Castles, Trees | AI Chronotopes | The Wrong Biennale 2026
Call for digital artists to join the world’s perhaps largest digital exhibition
Deadline: 15th September 2025
Exhibition launches globally 1st November 2025 and runs to 31st March.
Physical exhibitions can be found here: https://thewrong.org/
Outlining text:
We’re looking for digital artists working in all media to interpret
Artificial Intelligence in its broadest sense. Thirty artists will be
selected for exhibition. Free entry. Great networking opportunity.
Curated by Danish artist and photographer Kasper Bergholt in
collaboration with the Copenhagen Chronotopes Art Gallery, this
international sub-exhibition invites visual artists working in both
digital and physical mediums to explore poetic, dream-infused spaces at
the intersection of technology and imagination.
Inspired by Nick Cave’s 2024 song Cinnamon Horses, the curatorial theme
evokes ethereal worlds: horses that dance beneath strawberry moons,
wander castle ruins, and emerge in turpentine trees.
These surreal visions serve as a launching point for the exhibition’s
central question:
“What happens when AI dances, strolls, is found?”
Participating artists are invited to respond through still images, be it
a single artwork or a cohesive series of up to six. All image-making
techniques are welcome: from photography, painting, and mixed media to
generative art, graffiti, calligraphy, and more.

mur.at and the Collective Intelligence Association (CIA) are looking
for a number of artists or collectives to participate in a 5-day
artistic residency and worklab in Graz, Austria. Throughout the year,
mur.at has been collecting intelligence from artists, collectives, and
passersby in Graz and beyond. The selected artists will together
collaborate with CIA and the mur.at team to work with this collected
material and develop an artistic investigation that may take the form
of data-mining art, a documentary on intelligence, a net art
provocation, new software—or something entirely unexpected. The form
is open. The only condition is that it must emerge within the thematic
frame of collective intelligence. Since the annual theme is KI –
Kollektive Intelligenz (Collective Intelligence), we propose that the
structure of the five-day worklab – based on the idea of an open
Barcamp to the mur.at community – to be collectively defined by the
invited participants.

Since the annual theme is KI –<br> Kollektive Intelligenz (Collective Intelligence), we propose that the<br> structure of the five-day worklab – based on the idea of an open<br> Barcamp to the mur.at community – to be collectively defined by the<br> invited participants.</p><p><strong> Fee and travel/accommodation support provided</strong></p><p>Contact adresses/URL</p><p>All necessary details—including structure, timeline, and application<br> requirements—can be found in the open call here:<br><a href=https://mur.at/post/opencall-2025/ target=_blank>https://mur.at/post/opencall-2025/</a></p><p>Questions regarding the application process can be asked on the<br> channel @murpunktat on Mastodon, preferably with the hashtags:<br> #cia_mur2025 #worklab_mur2025</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://netex.nmartproject.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/25-opencall-cia-1024x576.jpg alt width=1024 height=576 class=""alignnone size-large wp-image-12875"" srcset=""https://netex.nmartproject.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/25-opencall-cia-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://netex.nmartproject.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/25-opencall-cia-300x169.jpg 300w, https://netex.nmartproject.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/25-opencall-cia-768x432.jpg 768w, https://netex.nmartproject.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/25-opencall-cia.jpg 1366w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px""></p><span class=post-schema><meta content=article itemscope itemprop=mainEntityOfPage itemtype=https://schema.org/WebPage itemid=""https://netex.nmartproject.net/?p=12874""><a itemprop=url href=""https://netex.nmartproject.net/?p=12874"" rel=bookmark title=""call: Residency – mur.at and Collective Intelligence Association (CIA) "">https://netex.nmartproject.net/?p=12874</a><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject>https://netex.nmartproject.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/25-opencall-cia-1024x576.jpg<meta itemprop=url content=https://netex.nmartproject.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/25-opencall-cia-1024x576.jpg><meta itemprop=width content=1024><meta itemprop=height content=576></span><span itemprop=thumbnailUrl>https://netex.nmartproject.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/25-opencall-cia-150x150.jpg</span><time datetime=2025-08-04 itemprop=datePublished><span class=""date updated"">2025-08-04T08:37:56+01:00</span></time><meta itemprop=dateModified content=2025-08-04T08:37:56+01:00><span class=""vcard author""><span class=fn>netty</span></span><span itemprop=articleSection>calls: general</span><span itemprop=articleSection>calls: residency</span><span itemprop=articleSection>residencies</span><span itemprop=description>Deadline: 14 August 2025 Call for entries mur.at and Collective Intelligence Association (CIA) – Open Call for Artist Residency &amp; Worklab August 14, 2025 (rolling review) Dates &amp; location of event context 5-day residency in Graz, Austria (December 1-5, 2025) mur.at and the Collective Intelligence Association (CIA) are looking for a number of artists or...</span><span itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><span itemprop=name>netty</span><a href=""?rel=author"" itemprop=url></a><span itemprop=givenName></span><span itemprop=familyName></span><span itemprop=email>artvideokoeln@gmail.com</span><span itemprop=jobTitle>Administrator</span><span itemprop=brand>netEX - calls &amp; deadlines</span></span><span itemprop=publisher itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/Organization><span itemprop=logo itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><img decoding=async alt=""@ The New Museum of Networked Art"" src=https://netex.nmartproject.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/cropped-adc-logo_trans_02.png><meta itemprop=url content=https://netex.nmartproject.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/cropped-adc-logo_trans_02.png><meta itemprop=width content=80><meta itemprop=height content=80></span><meta itemprop=name content=""netEX - calls & deadlines""></span></span></div>"

“Mirror Me”: Open Call for One-Off Moving Image Festival 2025
Exploring AI cloning, imitation, and how machines reflect or distort the ways humans (or machines) think of themselves: when machines mirror us, what remains uniquely human? We’re looking for 1-second video works exploring the complex relationship between AI and human identity and cognition, whether artistic, conceptual, philosophical, or other interpretations or reflections. When algorithms can mimic our voices, faces, and even our creativity, we ask: What is a mirror now? Is it a reflection, a copy, or something else entirely? What happens when the echo is more perfect than the original? What if we’re mirroring a specific, limited machine called ‘human’, and that in our vanity we feel our identity threatened instead of feeling humbled by being mirrored by a more powerful, general intelligence? Your 1-second video could be a concentrated burst of thought, a glimpse into the uncanny valley, or perhaps an absurd, profound reflection on the nature of being (human or machine). We encourage approaches that use humor, visual poetry, digital and conceptual art to challenge our perceptions. May your work be a flash of insight, a 1-second portal into the core of a digital identity crisis.

KUNSTRAUM is calling for submissions for our 2026 Artist-in-Residence Program.
KUNSTRAUM is a community of artists by artists with the goal of redefining the collaboration between artists and curators. Through our program, we aim to explore the relationships between artists and curators by opening our gallery spaces to those interested in exploring unconventional, engaging ideas and taking risks.
Our Artist-in-Residency program offers three-month residencies for national and international artists on a quarterly cycle. For 2026, we currently have open applications for January-March, April-June, July-September, and October-December.
All resident artists are invited to pursue their independent projects, interact with our established community of artists, designers, and filmmakers, interact with the incoming artists and curators of our ongoing exhibition program, participate in the monthly studio visits, and exhibit in the Annual Members’ show in the fall. To learn more about KUNSTRAUM, please visit our Website and Instagram account.
Each Residency Includes:
A desk-sized studio in our partitioned lofts with 24/7 access (no living). The semi-private studios inside the large open lofts range from 49 to 89 square feet.
Access to our gallery space (4-5 exhibitions a year) and participation in our Annual Members’ Show, including studio visit, professional documentation and programming event
Sales opportunities during the show plus via an online gallery for the duration of 6 months after
An artist community with 19 members and more than 100 alumni to meet and share with
Monthly studio visits by 1-2 New York and international curators, gallerists, critics, and art advisors (see “About” on website for the list)
Studio Visit with our Curator-in-Residence and monthly salons with artist community, social media promotion and a feature of your work on our website
Access to our internal monthly newsletter, which includes news, events, an open call list with exhibition, grant, and residency opportunities
Community events in which all resident and member artists are invited to attend. These community events vary and include gallery openings, curator walkthroughs, discussions, salons, and open studios.
The studio spaces have 24/7 access with 13 ft. ceilings, a freight elevator, slop sink, secure Wi-Fi, and are meant to be used for non-toxic materials only–all painters work on a non-toxic basis. Blick Art Supply, hardware stores, post office, print shops, supermarkets, restaurants, and delis are just 1.5 blocks away, and Home Depot is as close as 10 blocks.
No living is included. The resident artist is responsible for finding their own living and visa arrangements.
Fees:
The residency fee is $800 in 2026, with the following start dates: 1/2026; 4/2026; 7/1/2026; 10/1/2026;

KUNSTRAUM is born out of a necessity to create community and foster collaboration between artists, architects, curators, designers, filmmakers, and writers.

5-day residency in Graz, Austria (December 1-5, 2025)
mur.at and the Collective Intelligence Association (CIA) are looking
for a number of artists or collectives to participate in a 5-day
artistic residency and worklab in Graz, Austria. Throughout the year,
mur.at has been collecting intelligence from artists, collectives, and
passersby in Graz and beyond. The selected artists will together
collaborate with CIA and the mur.at team to work with this collected
material and develop an artistic investigation that may take the form
of data-mining art, a documentary on intelligence, a net art
provocation, new software—or something entirely unexpected. The form
is open. The only condition is that it must emerge within the thematic
frame of collective intelligence. Since the annual theme is KI –
Kollektive Intelligenz (Collective Intelligence), we propose that the
structure of the five-day worklab – based on the idea of an open
Barcamp to the mur.at community – to be collectively defined by the
invited participants.

Through a mix of mediums including painting, photography, illustration, and collage, subcultures aims to reflect on how fashion, music, political ideals, and shared lifestyles converge to create powerful subcultural identities. They encourage creators to capture the unique aesthetic markers of these groups but also their stories of solidarity, marginalization, and rebellion. subcultures is a tribute to the underground movements that challenge the status quo and enrich the cultural landscape through their bold, alternative visions of community and identity. </p></section>"

Nestled in the hillside of 39th Street and Dewey Avenue, the building subtly defines the campus edge while remaining true to the forms and materials of the surrounding neighborhood.
The building incorporates a collaborative floor design with flexible spaces crafted for student engagement. The residential facility will include studio, one-bedroom and two-bedroom units, which can house up to 300 UNMC Students. There will be other amenities, like a “grab-and-go” food option with indoor and outdoor seating, as well as first floor meeting and study spaces open to all UNMC students, faculty, and staff, including non-tenants. The new building also provides green space and connective pathways to promote interactions with nature and the surrounding campus life. This Request for Qualifications is for an exterior artwork site on the west side of the new Residence Hall. A variety of health professions students will call this building home. The Committee’s goal is to create a vibrant environment that welcomes people with an artwork that is refined, yet adds character and unique qualities to the building. The Committee would like the artwork to help the building stand apart from other buildings in Omaha, as a lively location that is clearly where health professions students study, play, relax, and most importantly, call home. Imagine, after a long day of clinical training, biomedical labwork, public health practicums, etc., arriving home to joyful artwork that invites residents and guests to use the other side of their brain.
The artwork does not have to have a literal tie to health professions, and can be abstract and/or non-representational. The letter of interest should descripte how your work would be a good fit for the building and the people using it, how it would achieve the goals listed in the RFQ, and, if applicable, and connections to health professions.
The artwork site is a portion of the wall on the west side of the building. The artwork can be adhered or installed onto the wall, and can have sculptural or relief qualities. The artwork can not be installed on the ground, or require footings in the ground. The materials should be durable and able to withstand Nebraska wind and weather. Additional details about potential artwork sites are on the following pages. Artists can use the entirety of wall the allocated. Quality over quantity and adherence to the budget, will be considered.

Anything But… is an annual exhibition series at Riverside Arts Center that invites artists to challenge assumptions about art materials and processes. Each year, the series sets aside a common material or convention, asking artists to explore alternative approaches. The goal is to spark experimentation, highlight innovation, and celebrate the many ways artists expand the language of contemporary art.
Riverside Arts Center invites artists to submit work for Anything But…New Materials, the second installment in our annual “Anything But…” exhibition series.
This exhibition will highlight works made primarily from recycled, reused, or repurposed materials, encouraging artists to step away from traditional, relied-upon art supplies and experiment with new ways of making. We’re looking for inventive approaches of working with familiar objects and work that shows how creativity can transform disparate materials into masterpieces!
Both 2D and 3D works are eligible.
NOTE: Artwork must be created with at least 75% recycled, reused, or repurposed materials. A limited amount of traditional supplies (adhesives, thread, paint, wire, etc.) may be used as supporting elements.

Nestled in the hillside of 39th Street and Dewey Avenue, the building subtly defines the campus edge while remaining true to the forms and materials of the surrounding neighborhood.
The building incorporates a collaborative floor design with flexible spaces crafted for student engagement. The residential facility will include studio, one-bedroom and two-bedroom units, which can house up to 300 UNMC Students. There will be other amenities, like a “grab-and-go” food option with indoor and outdoor seating, as well as first floor meeting and study spaces open to all UNMC students, faculty, and staff, including non-tenants. The new building also provides green space and connective pathways to promote interactions with nature and the surrounding campus life. This Call for Direct Purchased Artwork includes various wall locations for 2D artworks for the seating areas and hallways on the first floor, which will be available for residents, as well as UNMC employees. The spaces vary from recreational to quiet study areas, and the selection of art may reflect those moods. The Selection Committee is seeking work that already exists. Artists may submit individual works or series of works. Artists should explain the submission’s connection to the overall concept in the letter of interest, as applicable.

Acceptable media:
All types of pastel including soft pastel, hard pastel, oil pastel, ink pastel, water-based pastel, conté crayons or sticks, sanguine, and other dry mediums that are similar in their application including charcoal, chalk, and pencil.

Be part of CHOREOGRAPHIC podcast.
CHOREOGRAPHIC is created by choreographer Zornitsa Stoyanova (BUL/USA), director of BodyMeld, as a way to disseminate knowledge in the dance and improvisation fields. It is created through the use of AI and text and is generated only once (there is no machine learning or testing), which brings down AI energy costs and environmental impact.
The podcast is a comment on the present times of ever-dwindling funding for the arts and even less and less opportunities for dance artists to create work. This is an attempt to share the knowledge through little effort and with the ability to have a far reach.
To apply, fill out the application https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSceb8yla_87FgUYN8_vovCI5A-H2EfLfUa4tKHv9V8Es94qnQ/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=112258555486217472310.What you need:
– at least one article written by you in English, about either your own work, or academically written about dance history, dance research, improvisation, or interdisciplinarity.
– Every document needs to have YOUR NAME, YEAR WRITTEN, and ALL AUTHORS (if more than one).
– Zornitsa will personally read all articles.
If your work is featured in the podcast, you will first get the audio file, and only after your approval, the file will be uploaded and shared on Choreographic podcast. The podcast is anywhere between 5min. and 20min.
This podcast is completely based on a volunteer basis; thus, Zornitsa requests a 12 Euro application fee that will cover the time she will spend reading and interacting with your writing.
For any questions, contact her directly at zornitsa@bodymeld.org

We are seeking work from different dance genres (this could be Kathak, Contemporary, Hip Hop, African dance, traditional folk dances etc.) which offers new insights into ageing in the UK and around the world.
We are interested in the politics of the body, who is visible, who is celebrated and what we define as beautiful. We are interested in where age and experience hold power and status – and how dance can help us redefine our relationship to age and ageing.
WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FORWe are seeking proposals for:– Workshops and classes.– Performances (solos, duets, trios, small groups). Performances do not need to be full length. We can programme short pieces within double/ triple bills where appropriate. – Talks which expand our understanding of dance and age.– Films (documentary, screendance, installation)
Please note that you must be available to deliver your proposal at Ageless 2026 on 17 and/or 18 July 2026.
We have a limited programming budget and you will be asked to provide your fee within your proposal submission.
How to apply:Please complete the form on Yorkshire Dance’s website no later than midday on Monday 17 November 2025: https://yorkshiredance.com/opportunity/ageless-2026/

Le premier atelier aura lieu le samedi 1er novembre, de 14h à 17h. Thématique de l’année : ""Écritures et mémoires""Cette nouvelle édition sera consacrée à l’exploration des rapports entre mémoire et écriture. Les archives historiques comme l’intimité des souvenirs se trouvent souvent au cœur du processus créatif, à la croisée de la création, de la restitution et de la résistance. Les participant·e·s seront invité·e·s à interroger des questions essentielles : Quelle part de la mémoire est volontaire, et quelle part relève de l’inconscient ? Comment l’écriture articule-t-elle mémoire individuelle et mémoire collective ? Quels rapports entretiennent réminiscence et amnésie dans l’acte de création ? La fiction doit-elle être fidèle à la mémoire, ou peut-elle la trahir ? Quels mythes et contes nourrissent notre mémoire et façonnent nos récits ?

Zoé Tullen“La pratique artistique de Zoé Tullen s’inspire d’un constat : les machines sont, avec les fxmmes, soumises au patriarcat par des mécanismes communs. Que ce soit en volume physique ou virtuel, son travail en trois dimensions révèle précisément l’objectification subie par ces deux groupes humain et non‐humain.”

C’est la question que se posent ensemble la Cité internationale des arts et les Scénos Urbaines en accueillant en résidence une trentaine d’artistes et en co-construisant une exposition. Elle interroge, via des gestes pluridisciplinaires et spéculatifs, le devenir de la ville et la place des artistes au sein de celle-ci, autour de ce lieu de résidence situé au centre de Paris et au cœur des enjeux urbains contemporains.
Le CCS résident de la Cité depuis 2022, le temps de ses travaux de rénovation, a été invité à dialoguer avec le collectif et à proposer à deux artistes à participer au projet : Vincente Lesser et Sélima Chibout.
La Cité internationale des arts est un îlot du Tout-Monde, qui célèbre en 2025 ses 60 ans. Des artistes y travaillent et y vivent pour des périodes de recherche et de production de deux mois à un an, et rencontrent plus de 300 artistes de toutes pratiques, générations et nationalités. Comment vivent-ils et elles la présence simultanée de Notre-Dame et des migrants, la gentrification de la ville, les enjeux du vivant ? Comment cette ville accueille-t-elle aujourd’hui au quotidien le monde, les manières de vivre dans leur diversité, hors des moments spectacles où cette diversité est célébrée mais sélective. Depuis 2002, ces enjeux sont ceux des Scénos Urbaines, un ensemble de résidences pluridisciplinaires fondées sur une attention aux milieux urbains et à celles et ceux qui y vivent, à ce jour réalisées à Douala, Alexandrie, Kinshasa, Johannesburg, Dakar, Saint-Denis de la Réunion, Port-au-Prince, Conakry, Strasbourg et Mayotte.
Le projet se développe en deux temps : entre août et octobre 2025, une trentaine d’artistes en résidence travailleront ensemble, autour de la question de ce qu’est aujourd’hui cette ville qui s’est souvent pensée ouverte et inclusive. Puis, à partir du 8 octobre, une exposition accueillera les publics et présentera le résultat de ces deux mois d’échanges, de recherche et de productions avec aussi une série d’événements les 8, 9 et 10 octobre et les ateliers ouverts les mercredis.
Avec les artistes : Bruno Carpentier, Sélima Chibout, Saad Eltinay, Nathalie Harb, Inssa Hassna, Djodjo Kazadi, Jeanne Tara, Vicente Lesser, Sandra Madi, Gabriela de Matos, Cara Michell, Androa Mindre Kolo, Mega Mingiedi Tunga, Oliver Musovik, Lasseindra Ninja, Léonce Noah, Efrin Özyetiş, Scénos Urbaines (François Duconseille et Jean Christophe Lanquetin), Sello Pesa, Rester.Étranger, Ika Ryu, Beatriz Santiago Munoz, Kristina Solomoukha + Paulo Codeluppi + Barbara Manzetti, Samuel Suffren, Ika Yuliana.
Avec la collaboration de : Lotte Arndt, Catherine Facerias, Léopold Lambert, Olivier Marboeuf, Marielle Pelissero.
Commissariat : Scénos Urbaines (François Duconseille et Jean Christophe Lanquetin, artistes et scénographes) et Nataša Petrešin-Bachelez, responsable de la programmation artistique et culturelle à la Cité internationale des arts, assistés par Simona Dvorák, commisaire interdépendante.
Paris des vi(ll)es - Vue aérienne de Paris, circa 1960 © Photo issue du fonds d’archives de la Cité internationale des artsSélima ChiboutSélima Chibout est ethnologue, vidéaste et dramaturge. Formée en linguistique, ethnologie et anthropologie entre Neuchâtel et Paris-Nanterre, elle développe une pratique mêlant recherche en sciences sociales et création audiovisuelle. Ses films, dont Cadeaux du Locle (2017) et Vieilliérâ (2019), ont été présentés dans plusieurs festivals internationaux et institutions. Membre active de l’Association, Rechercher, Ethnologie, Cinéma (aREC) depuis 2018, elle réalise plusieurs films pour des institutions culturelles mêlant les outils formels de la recherche en science sociale et la vidéo. Depuis 2020 elle travaille en tant qu’assistante réalisatrice au sein du collectif Climage à Lausanne et accompagne des projets d’arts vivants en tant que dramaturge. En 2024, en résidence à la Cité internationale des arts à Paris, elle développe un journal vidéo et un court-métrage MIAOU autour des récits de chats perdus qui explore les distorsions spatiales, temporelles et symboliques dans lesquels ces expériences nous embarquent. Elle enseigne actuellement l’anthropologie visuelle à l’Université de Neuchâtel et codirige la programmation cinéma du centre culturel ABC à La Chaux-de-Fonds.

Vincente LesserLe travail de Vicente Lesser Gutierrez repense de manière à la fois subtile et extrêmement poétique la façon dont nous vivons l’espace urbain contemporain. Ce faisant, il ne recourt pas aux grands mythes et ne s’engage pas dans des discussions disciplinaires ; au contraire, il se déplace dans une ville construite sur des mémoires, des désirs et des signes de langage.
Une ville formée par l’expérience de l’espace vécu, qui ne survit que par la mémoire. Une ville faite des gestes rebelles de ceux qui y vivent et y survivent, de ceux qui l’habitent, sur la texture rugueuse du béton qui offre ici et là les reflets d’une autre époque. Une ville qui émerge parfois à l’intérieur d’autres villes.
Une ville composée de beaucoup d’autres – car son travail est aussi la preuve d’un parcours migratoire, un va-et-vient entre Santiago et Genève, un voyage permanent entre des lieux et temps. En quoi l’expérience des villes que nous habitons nous influence-t-elle ? Comment sont-elles traduites et traversées ? Dans son atelier, Vicente travaille avec ces éléments. Il les traduit, les déchire, les élargit et les rétrécit, les soustrait et les recompose. C’est alors que la ville invisible commence à émerger.
Mobilisée depuis les puits de la mémoire, depuis les profondeurs des structures du pouvoir, depuis le toucher et l’hapticité de ses matériaux, la ville, pourtant disparue, fait ressurgir des expériences et des souvenirs qui reviennent et se répètent, inlassablement.

C’est alors que la ville invisible commence à émerger.<br> Mobilisée depuis les puits de la mémoire, depuis les profondeurs des structures du pouvoir, depuis le toucher et l’hapticité de ses matériaux, la ville, pourtant disparue, fait ressurgir des expériences et des souvenirs qui reviennent et se répètent, inlassablement.<br> – Romàn Alonso Gomez </p><p><a href=https://vicentelesser.ch/ target=_blank rel=""noreferrer noopener"">www.vincentlesser.ch</a></p></div><div class=gallery><div class=gallery_images><picture id=image-4><source data-srcset=""https://media.ccsparis.com/88837/vicente_lesser_remembranza_3_2022.960x0.webp 960w, https://media.ccsparis.com/88837/vicente_lesser_remembranza_3_2022.webp 2x"" type=image/webp><source data-srcset=""https://media.ccsparis.com/88837/vicente_lesser_remembranza_3_2022.960x0.jpg 960w, https://media.ccsparis.com/88837/vicente_lesser_remembranza_3_2022.jpg 2x"" type=image/jpeg><img class=""lazyload landscape"" src=https://media.ccsparis.com/88837/vicente_lesser_remembranza_3_2022.300x0.jpg srcset=""https://media.ccsparis.com/88837/vicente_lesser_remembranza_3_2022.600x0.jpg 2x"" width=300 height=200 alt=""© Vicente Lesser, <em>Remembranza</em>, 2022""></picture><a href=#image-5></a><picture id=image-5 style=""left: 100%""><source data-srcset=""https://media.ccsparis.com/88837/vicente_lesser_el_diablo_va_a_la_pega_para_esconderse_en_los_escombros_del_presente_c_bastien_verdon.750x0.webp 750w, https://media.ccsparis.com/88837/vicente_lesser_el_diablo_va_a_la_pega_para_esconderse_en_los_escombros_del_presente_c_bastien_verdon.webp 2x"" type=image/webp><source data-srcset=""https://media.ccsparis.com/88837/vicente_lesser_el_diablo_va_a_la_pega_para_esconderse_en_los_escombros_del_presente_c_bastien_verdon.750x0.jpg 750w, https://media.ccsparis.com/88837/vicente_lesser_el_diablo_va_a_la_pega_para_esconderse_en_los_escombros_del_presente_c_bastien_verdon.jpg 2x"" type=image/jpeg><img class=""lazyload portrait"" src=https://media.ccsparis.com/88837/vicente_lesser_el_diablo_va_a_la_pega_para_esconderse_en_los_escombros_del_presente_c_bastien_verdon.300x0.jpg srcset=""https://media.ccsparis.com/88837/vicente_lesser_el_diablo_va_a_la_pega_para_esconderse_en_los_escombros_del_presente_c_bastien_verdon.600x0.jpg 2x"" width=300 height=400 alt=""Vicente Lesser, <em>El diablo va a la pega para esconderse en los escombros del presente</em>, 2023 © Bastien Verdon""></picture><a href=#image-6 style=""left: 100%""></a><picture id=image-6 style=""left: 200%""><source data-srcset=""https://media.ccsparis.com/88837/vincente_lesser_another_gate_to_llano_del_rio_2023_photo_severin_bigler.960x0.webp 960w, https://media.ccsparis.com/88837/vincente_lesser_another_gate_to_llano_del_rio_2023_photo_severin_bigler.webp 2x"" type=image/webp><source data-srcset=""https://media.ccsparis.com/88837/vincente_lesser_another_gate_to_llano_del_rio_2023_photo_severin_bigler.960x0.jpg 960w, https://media.ccsparis.com/88837/vincente_lesser_another_gate_to_llano_del_rio_2023_photo_severin_bigler.jpg 2x"" type=image/jpeg><img class=""lazyload landscape"" src=https://media.ccsparis.com/88837/vincente_lesser_another_gate_to_llano_del_rio_2023_photo_severin_bigler.300x0.jpg srcset=""https://media.ccsparis.com/88837/vincente_lesser_another_gate_to_llano_del_rio_2023_photo_severin_bigler.600x0.jpg 2x"" width=300 height=200 alt=""Vicente Lesser, <em>Another gate to llano del Rio</em>, 2023 © Severin Bigler""></picture><a href=#image-4 style=""left: 200%""></a> </div><footer class=gallery_footer><div class=gallery_description><p>© Vicente Lesser, <em>Remembranza</em>, 2022</p> </div><div class=gallery_pagination><span class=gallery_current-page>1</span> / 3 </div></footer></div><details class=detail><summary>Partenaires</summary><div class=logos><div class=logo><img src=https://media.ccsparis.com/88687/1_-_pastille_noirz.png style=max-width:73%></div><div class=logo><img src=https://media.ccsparis.com/88687/fa_logo_2lignes.png></div></div></details> </div>"

Léa Katharina Meier, 'Le fabuleux destin de Monsieur Della Merde'Horaires de passage :
Entre 15:00 et 16:00
Entre 18:00 et 19:00
Léa Katharina Meier, en collaboration avec Tatiana Baumgartner, propose un solo centré sur un élément récurrent de sa pratique artistique : le storytelling.
Dans Le fabuleux destin de Monsieur Della Merde, son alter ego clownesque, Monsieur Della Merde, vient raconter une série de petites histoires qui ont marqué son fabuleux destin. Entre logorrhée, comptine enfantine, victime et bourreau, tour de magie, prise d’otage, crise d’hystérie et chanson paillarde, ce personnage oscillant saura tour à tour séduire, effrayer et attendrir.
Le fabuleux destin de Monsieur Della Merde est un extrait solo de la pièce collective Terminale Hysteria, conçue et mise-en-scène par Tatiana Baumgartner et Léa Katharina Meieréléments biographiquesLéa Katharina Meier (née en 1989 en Suisse) est une artiste scénique et visuelle. Utilisant le clown comme pratique performative, sa recherche se concentre sur les notions de ridicule, d’abjection et de jubilation afin de créer un univers visuel et sensoriel qui embrasse le public. A partir de ses échecs intimes, elle souhaite développer un humour et une poésie lesbienne et sale. Sur scène, elle s’attache à incarner des émotions définies comme négatives comme une source de plaisir. Le conte, le corps comme archive, la féminité grotesque, la honte ainsi qu’un univers aux caractères enfantins sont des motifs récurrents au sein de sa pratique. Léa Katharina Meier a montré son travail dans de nombreux espaces d’art et théâtres en Suisse, en Italie et au Brésil (Arsenic, Tunnel Tunnel, MCBA, TU-Théâtre de l’Usine, Lateral Roma, Istituto Svizzero, Pivô arte e pesquisa). En 2021, elle reçoit le Prix suisse de la performance pour “Tous les sexes tombent du ciel”. En 2023, elle fait partie de l’exposition des Swiss Art Awards à Bâle. Elle a été résidente de l’Institut suisse de Rome en 23-24 et a récemment reçu le prix de la Fondation Irène Reymond à Lausanne. En 2025, elle montrera son travail scénique au sein de la Sélection Suisse en Avignon ainsi que de Performissima à Paris.
“Je suis une artiste visuelle, performeuse et metteuse-en-scène. Au sein de ma pratique, je m’intéresse à la thématique du ridicule, du malaise et de l’abjection et à comment ces sentiments peuvent être réinvestis avec humour et bienveillance dans une perspective de rire et de guérison. En développant une langue propre à mon travail, je souhaite constituer une poésie sale et lesbienne. Le livre, la bibliothèque, les archives, la mémoire, le storytelling et la construction d’un univers esthétique aux caractéristiques enfantines sont également des motifs récurrents dans mes travaux. Depuis plusieurs années, la théorie des affects et plus particulièrement la question de la honte occupent une place centrale dans ma pratique. Je l’aborde dans une perspective intime, corporelle, collective et politique. Je souhaite poser un regard critique et amusé sur les structures autoritaires, telles que les archives, la famille, l’école, l’hétérosexualité ou encore la langue, qui polissent nos mémoires, nos savoirs, nos désirs et nos sexualités. En opposition à l’humour normatif qui perpétue des mécanismes oppressifs, j’utilise la pratique du clown comme stratégie de création de rire et d’imaginaires alternatifs et pédéexs.” - Léa Katharina MeierCréditsConcept, collaboration artistique et mise-en-scène: Léa Katharina Meier et Tatiana Baumgartner

Dorota Gawęda and Eglė Kulbokaitė, 'Brood (Scène 4) : Possession Undone'Horaires de passage :
Entre 18:00 et 19:00
Brood (Scène 4) : Possession Undone réinvente le passage de possession du personnage d’Anna/Helen, interprété par Isabelle Adjani dans le film Possession (1981) d’Andrzej Żuławski. Diffusée en direct depuis le passage souterrain et les coulisses du CWB, la performance in situ de la performeuse Anna Marchenko met en scène la déconstruction de ce moment cinématographique emblématique, prolongé dans la durée et réexaminé par l’artiste en temps réel. Le public n’en perçoit que l’expérience médiatisée.
Brood (Scène 4) : Possession Undone est une nouvelle création développée à partir de la quatrième scène de la performance BROOD, d’une durée de six heures, commandée par le Centre Pompidou à Paris pour Move 2023.
La performance s’articule autour du thème du double, central à la fois dans le film de Żuławski — notamment dans la construction du personnage incarné par Adjani — et dans la pratique récurrente de Dorota Gawęda et Eglė Kulbokaitė. La série de performances et de vidéos BROOD explore les imposteur·es, les jumeaux/jumelles, les profils sur les réseaux sociaux et les fantômes : une présence simultanée de soi et de l’autre, convoquant les doppelgängers, ces miroirs indésirables qui renvoient des versions distordues et troublantes du moi.
Ce motif culturel récurrent prend une signification nouvelle à mesure que les traditions populaires se mêlent aux technologies émergentes. Le double fracture la vision, remet en question les notions figées de l’identité et prend une nouvelle forme à travers notre « second moi numérique », tel que le décrit Daisy Hildyard — une présence à la fois réelle et distante, qui façonne nos interactions de manière invisible.élements biographiquesDorota Gawęda (PL/CH) et Eglė Kulbokaitė (LT/CH) sont toutes deux diplômées du Royal College of Art de Londres. Elles travaillent dans une pluralité de médiums : performance, peinture, sculpture, fragrance, vidéo et installation – là où le langage se défait et où un genre se transforme en plusieurs. Elles ont exposé à l’international, notamment à la Renaissance Society de Chicago, chez Thaddaeus Ropac à Paris, au Centre Georges-Pompidou à Paris, à la Biennale de Vilnius, à la Kunsthalle Mainz, au Kunstverein Hamburg, à l’Istituto Svizzero de Palerme et Milan, au Swiss Institute de New York, à la Julia Stoschek Collection de Düsseldorf, à la Kunsthalle Fribourg, à Lafayette Anticipations à Paris, au Palais de Tokyo à Paris, à la Biennale d’Athènes, à la Kunsthalle Basel, à l’ICA de Londres, au Museum of Modern Art de Varsovie, entre autres. Elles sont les fondatrices du YOUNG GIRL READING GROUP (2013–2021), lauréates de l’Allegro Artist Prize 2022, de la résidence CERN Collide 2022, ainsi que du Swiss Performance Art Award 2021. Actuellement en résidence à la Cité des Arts à Paris, elles préparent une exposition personnelle au MACA, Beijing, prévue pour l’automne 2025.
Dorota Gawęda et Eglė Kulbokaitė travaillent dans une pluralité de médiums – performance, peinture, sculpture, fragrance, vidéo et installation – là où le langage se défait et où un genre se transforme en plusieurs. En transmettant et croisant différents corps de savoirs à travers l’espace et le temps, elles développent une pratique fondée sur la recherche, qui tisse ensemble des champs apparemment disparates : écologie et technologie, science et magie, intelligence non-humaine et spéculation partagée. Les artistes explorent actuellement le motif du double à travers la culture populaire, l’art, le folklore et la technologie, afin de démêler les fils de l’identité contemporaine, en interrogeant les frontières du soi dans un monde où le réel et le virtuel sont de plus en plus imbriqués et brouillés.

Sofia Kouloukouri, 'ELECTRIC WRATH'Horaires de passage :
Entre 16:00 et 17:00
Entre 18:00 et 19:00
ELECTRIC WRATH est une performance dansé qui explore la force collective des femmes et leur visibilité en tant que corps uni. Expérience au-delà des mots, elle met en scène la colère féminine et son impact. Un dispositif porté à la main transforme l’énergie cinétique des interprètes en électricité, rendant leur présence tangible. L’intensité et la répétition plongent le corps collectif dans une transe de fureur.
La pièce traduit un état émotionnel en force élémentaire. Elle questionne ainsi l’autosuffisance énergétique : l’impact environnemental d’une pratique artistique devient crucial, même en performance, et ELECTRIC WRATH met la colère féminine au service de cette énergie. La pièce constitue aussi un entraînement physique, une recherche d’équilibre vivant et collectif, explorant la dynamique de groupe et ses possibilités de puissance et d’action partagée.élements biographiquesSOFI KORI (nom de scène de Sofia Kouloukouri) est artiste visuelle, performeuse, écrivaine et historienne de l’art. Dans son travail, les corps féminins affrontent des poids réels et affectifs, explorant physiquement ce que signifie être solide en tant que femme aujourd’hui. KORI est titulaire d’une licence et d’un master en études cinématographiques (AUTH, Thessalonique), d’un master en arts visuels (Edhea, Sierre) et d’un master en histoire de l’art (UNIGE, Genève). Ses recherches académiques portent sur les femmes, l’art, le sexe et l’agentivité. Ses textes ont été publiés par Nero Editions, Miami Books et The Art Newspaper. Son premier livre Artistes femmes et travail du sexe est paru chez L’Harmattan en mars 2025. Le travail de KORI a été présenté, entre autres, à : Roman Road Londres, Théâtre du Grütli Genève, Museo de Arte Contemporáneo Buenos Aires (MACBA), Musée cantonal des Beaux-Arts Lausanne (MCBA), Palais de Rumine Lausanne, MIR festival, Kunsthal Charlottenborg Copenhague, Roma Diffusa, Phenomenon Studios Reykjavik, ArtAthina, Museo Nacional y Centro de Investigación de Altamira. En 2024, elle a participé à ORGANISMO, programme de recherche de TBA21 sur l’art et les écologies appliquées critiques. Elle est actuellement en résidence à la Cité internationale des Arts à Paris.
À travers l’endurance et la narration, le travail de SOFI KORI interroge les poids réels et affectifs comme héritage féminin, issu de l’éducation des filles, des mythes et des doctrines religieuses. Ses performances prennent la forme de solos narratifs ou de performances physiques proches de l’entraînement.CréditsCréée à Buenos Aires, ELECTRIC WRATH a été présentée pour la première fois au Museo de Arte Contemporáneo Buenos Aires (MACBA), puis à l’Espace Movaq en 2022. Une nouvelle version a été co-produite et présentée au MIR Festival à Athènes en 2023, puis à l’espace M54 à Athènes et au Roma Diffusa Festival en 2024. Les interprètes de ELECTRIC WRATH se font appeler les RE-SISTERS.

Nkisi (Melika Ngombe Kolongo) & Tiran Willemse, 'When the calabash breaks'Horaires de passage :
Entre 17:00 et 18:00
Entre 21:00 et 22:00
« When the calabash breaks » est une expression couramment utilisée dans les cultures africaines pour désigner une rupture ou une perte majeure, souvent liée à un effondrement des traditions, de la communauté, ou d’un aspect essentiel de la vie. Selon le contexte, elle peut également représenter la perte d’une vie ou un changement radical dans l’existence de quelqu’un·e. La calebasse, précieuse gourde servant à conserver l’eau et la nourriture, incarne un bien vital.
Ce projet naît de la rencontre et de la recherche commune entre le danseur et chorégraphe Tiran Willemse et la musicienne et compositrice Melika Ngombe Kolongo (Nkisi). When the calabash breaks s’enracine dans des cosmologies spirituelles et des rituels afro-diasporiques, en mobilisant l’improvisation comme pratique à la fois transformatrice et politique. Le son, intense et stratifié, agit comme une force vivante capable d’affecter le temps et l’espace, tandis que le mouvement explore des dimensions énergétiques, la mémoire ancestrale et les dynamiques collectives.
Ensemble, iels créent une performance-rituel expérimentale, une trame explosive de musique et de danse façonnée pour dialoguer avec l’architecture, passée comme présente.éléments biographiquesBasé à Zurich, le danseur et chorégraphe sud-africain Tiran Willemse a étudié à P.A.R.T.S. (Bruxelles) ainsi qu’à la Haute école des arts de Berne (HKB). Sa pratique chorégraphique examine avec précision l’espace, l’imagination, le geste et le son, en interrogeant la manière dont ces éléments participent à la construction du genre et de la mémoire. Tiran a collaboré avec des chorégraphes tels que Trajal Harrell, Jérôme Bel, Wu Tsang, Ligia Lewis, Meg Stuart, Andros Zins-Browne, Eszter Salamon et Deborah Hay. En 2022, il a remporté le Prix suisse de la performance.
Nkisi est une musicienne et artiste basée à Londres, d’origine congolaise. Elle utilise le rythme, le son et le bruit comme autant de moyens d’activer les traces de mémoire inscrites dans et par le corps en mouvement. À travers des codes sensoriels, elle croise musique, performance et recherche sur des technologies musicales ancestrales, invitant les publics à danser avec l’invisible et à activer des formes incarnées de révolution et de résistance pour le « défaire » et le « refaire » des mondes.
La recherche de mouvement s’articule autour de structures improvisées permettant une fluidité entre chorégraphie écrite et prises de décision en temps réel. L’approche de Willemse est profondément ancrée dans son exploration continue de la présence, du poids et des dynamiques relationnelles au sein de l’ensemble et avec le public. Le langage physique de la pièce s’inspire à la fois de la club culture, de la danse postmoderne et d’expressions corporelles issues de la diaspora, construisant ainsi un vocabulaire chorégraphique stratifié et dynamique. Au fil de résidences de recherche, Willemse développe des séquences de mouvement en réponse aux paysages sonores de Kolongo, permettant à la chorégraphie d’évoluer en dialogue avec les processus génératifs de la musique en direct. Le travail de répétition explore également l’impact des configurations spatiales sur les relations corporelles, testant différentes proximités et modes d’interaction entre interprètes et spectateur·rice·s.
Les paysages sonores de Kolongo constituent une composante essentielle de la performance, influençant non seulement l’environnement auditif mais aussi la structure des mouvements et l’expérience du public. Ses compositions mêlent séquences polyrythmiques, éléments percussifs marqués et textures électroniques expérimentales, pour créer une atmosphère immersive et intense. L’improvisation et la performance live occupent une place centrale dans cette dramaturgie sonore. Kolongo développera une partition évolutive capable de s’adapter à différents contextes de présentation – des scènes de festivals en plein air aux espaces intimes d’un théâtre « black box ». L’articulation entre densité sonore, silence et résonance sera déterminante pour définir l’arc global de la pièce.

Utilisant le clown comme pratique performative, sa recherche se concentre sur les notions de ridicule, d’abjection et de jubilation afin de créer un univers visuel et sensoriel qui embrasse le public. A partir de ses échecs intimes, elle souhaite développer un humour et une poésie lesbienne et sale. Sur scène, elle s’attache à incarner des émotions définies comme négatives comme une source de plaisir. Le conte, le corps comme archive, la féminité grotesque, la honte ainsi qu’un univers aux caractères enfantins sont des motifs récurrents au sein de sa pratique. Léa Katharina Meier a montré son travail dans de nombreux espaces d’art et théâtres en Suisse, en Italie et au Brésil (Arsenic, Tunnel Tunnel, MCBA, TU-Théâtre de l’Usine, Lateral Roma, Istituto Svizzero, Pivô arte e pesquisa). En 2021, elle reçoit le Prix suisse de la performance pour “Tous les sexes tombent du ciel”. En 2023, elle fait partie de l’exposition des Swiss Art Awards à Bâle. Elle a été résidente de l’Institut suisse de Rome en 23-24 et a récemment reçu le prix de la Fondation Irène Reymond à Lausanne. En 2025, elle montrera son travail scénique au sein de la Sélection Suisse en Avignon ainsi que de Performissima à Paris. </p><p>“<em>Je suis une artiste visuelle, performeuse et metteuse-en-scène. Au sein de ma pratique, je m’intéresse à la thématique du ridicule, du malaise et de l’abjection et à comment ces sentiments peuvent être réinvestis avec humour et bienveillance dans une perspective de rire et de guérison. En développant une langue propre à mon travail, je souhaite constituer une poésie sale et lesbienne. Le livre, la bibliothèque, les archives, la mémoire, le storytelling et la construction d’un univers esthétique aux caractéristiques enfantines sont également des motifs récurrents dans mes travaux. Depuis plusieurs années, la théorie des affects et plus particulièrement la question de la honte occupent une place centrale dans ma pratique. Je l’aborde dans une perspective intime, corporelle, collective et politique. Je souhaite poser un regard critique et amusé sur les structures autoritaires, telles que les archives, la famille, l’école, l’hétérosexualité ou encore la langue, qui polissent nos mémoires, nos savoirs, nos désirs et nos sexualités. En opposition à l’humour normatif qui perpétue des mécanismes oppressifs, j’utilise la pratique du clown comme stratégie de création de rire et d’imaginaires alternatifs et pédéexs</em>.” - Léa Katharina Meier</p></details><details class=detail><summary>Crédits</summary><p>Concept, collaboration artistique et mise-en-scène: Léa Katharina Meier et Tatiana Baumgartner<br> Performance, texte et visuels: Léa Katharina Meier<br> Costume: Safia Semlali<br> Production, administration et diffusion: Artemisia Romano<br> Equipe de création et de production de « Terminale Hysteria »: Tatiana Baumgartner, Léa Katharina Meier, Maria-Fernanda Ordonnez Pinzon, Dominique Gilliot, Adina Secretan, Vicky Althaus, Charlotte Carteret, Guits, Redwan Reys, Nayansaku Mufwankolo, Safia Semlali, Artemisia Romano</p></details><div class=gallery><div class=gallery_images><picture id=image-5><source data-srcset=""https://media.ccsparis.com/88733/3__c_caterina_zevola.540x0.webp 540w, https://media.ccsparis.com/88733/3__c_caterina_zevola.webp 2x"" type=image/webp><source data-srcset=""https://media.ccsparis.com/88733/3__c_caterina_zevola.540x0.jpg 540w, https://media.ccsparis.com/88733/3__c_caterina_zevola.jpg 2x"" type=image/jpeg><img class=""lazyload portrait"" src=https://media.ccsparis.com/88733/3__c_caterina_zevola.300x0.jpg srcset=""https://media.ccsparis.com/88733/3__c_caterina_zevola.600x0.jpg 2x"" width=300 height=400 alt=""Léa Katharina Meier © Caterina Zevola""></picture><a href=#image-6></a><picture id=image-6 style=""left: 100%""><source data-srcset=""https://media.ccsparis.com/88733/1__c_neige_sanchez.1000x0.webp 1000w, https://media.ccsparis.com/88733/1__c_neige_sanchez.webp 2x"" type=image/webp><source data-srcset=""https://media.ccsparis.com/88733/1__c_neige_sanchez.1000x0.jpg 1000w, https://media.ccsparis.com/88733/1__c_neige_sanchez.jpg 2x"" type=image/jpeg><img class=""lazyload portrait"" src=https://media.ccsparis.com/88733/1__c_neige_sanchez.300x0.jpg srcset=""https://media.ccsparis.com/88733/1__c_neige_sanchez.600x0.jpg 2x"" width=300 height=450 alt=""Léa Katharina Meier © Neige Sanchez""></picture><a href=#image-7 style=""left: 100%""></a><picture id=image-7 style=""left: 200%""><source data-srcset=""https://media.ccsparis.com/88733/2__c_neige_sanchez.1000x0.webp 1000w, https://media.ccsparis.com/88733/2__c_neige_sanchez.webp 2x"" type=image/webp><source data-srcset=""https://media.ccsparis.com/88733/2__c_neige_sanchez.1000x0.jpg 1000w, https://media.ccsparis.com/88733/2__c_neige_sanchez.jpg 2x"" type=image/jpeg><img class=""lazyload portrait"" src=https://media.ccsparis.com/88733/2__c_neige_sanchez.300x0.jpg srcset=""https://media.ccsparis.com/88733/2__c_neige_sanchez.600x0.jpg 2x"" width=300 height=450 alt=""Léa Katharina Meier © Neige Sanchez""></picture><a href=#image-5 style=""left: 200%""></a> </div><footer class=gallery_footer><div class=gallery_description><p>Léa Katharina Meier © Caterina Zevola</p> </div><div class=gallery_pagination><span class=gallery_current-page>1</span> / 3 </div></footer></div><h2>Dorota Gawęda and Eglė Kulbokaitė, 'Brood (Scène 4) : Possession Undone'</h2><div class=times><p><em>Horaires de passage :<br> Entre 18:00 et 19:00</em><br><br><em>Brood (Scène 4) : Possession Undone</em> réinvente le passage de possession du personnage d’Anna/Helen, interprété par Isabelle Adjani dans le film <em>Possession</em> (1981) d’Andrzej Żuławski.

Elle questionne ainsi l’autosuffisance énergétique : l’impact environnemental d’une pratique artistique devient crucial, même en performance, et ELECTRIC WRATH met la colère féminine au service de cette énergie. La pièce constitue aussi un entraînement physique, une recherche d’équilibre vivant et collectif, explorant la dynamique de groupe et ses possibilités de puissance et d’action partagée.</p></div><details class=detail><summary>élements biographiques</summary><p>SOFI KORI (nom de scène de Sofia Kouloukouri) est artiste visuelle, performeuse, écrivaine et historienne de l’art. Dans son travail, les corps féminins affrontent des poids réels et affectifs, explorant physiquement ce que signifie être solide en tant que femme aujourd’hui. KORI est titulaire d’une licence et d’un master en études cinématographiques (AUTH, Thessalonique), d’un master en arts visuels (Edhea, Sierre) et d’un master en histoire de l’art (UNIGE, Genève). Ses recherches académiques portent sur les femmes, l’art, le sexe et l’agentivité. Ses textes ont été publiés par Nero Editions, Miami Books et The Art Newspaper. Son premier livre Artistes femmes et travail du sexe est paru chez L’Harmattan en mars 2025. Le travail de KORI a été présenté, entre autres, à : Roman Road Londres, Théâtre du Grütli Genève, Museo de Arte Contemporáneo Buenos Aires (MACBA), Musée cantonal des Beaux-Arts Lausanne (MCBA), Palais de Rumine Lausanne, MIR festival, Kunsthal Charlottenborg Copenhague, Roma Diffusa, Phenomenon Studios Reykjavik, ArtAthina, Museo Nacional y Centro de Investigación de Altamira. En 2024, elle a participé à ORGANISMO, programme de recherche de TBA21 sur l’art et les écologies appliquées critiques. Elle est actuellement en résidence à la Cité internationale des Arts à Paris.</p><p>À travers l’endurance et la narration, le travail de SOFI KORI interroge les poids réels et affectifs comme héritage féminin, issu de l’éducation des filles, des mythes et des doctrines religieuses. Ses performances prennent la forme de solos narratifs ou de performances physiques proches de l’entraînement.</p></details><details class=detail><summary>Crédits</summary><p>Créée à Buenos Aires, ELECTRIC WRATH a été présentée pour la première fois au Museo de Arte Contemporáneo Buenos Aires (MACBA), puis à l’Espace Movaq en 2022.

Selon le contexte, elle peut également représenter la perte d’une vie ou un changement radical dans l’existence de quelqu’un·e. La calebasse, précieuse gourde servant à conserver l’eau et la nourriture, incarne un bien vital.</p><p>Ce projet naît de la rencontre et de la recherche commune entre le danseur et chorégraphe Tiran Willemse et la musicienne et compositrice Melika Ngombe Kolongo (Nkisi).<em> When the calabash breaks</em> s’enracine dans des cosmologies spirituelles et des rituels afro-diasporiques, en mobilisant l’improvisation comme pratique à la fois transformatrice et politique. Le son, intense et stratifié, agit comme une force vivante capable d’affecter le temps et l’espace, tandis que le mouvement explore des dimensions énergétiques, la mémoire ancestrale et les dynamiques collectives.</p><p>Ensemble, iels créent une performance-rituel expérimentale, une trame explosive de musique et de danse façonnée pour dialoguer avec l’architecture, passée comme présente.</p></div><details class=detail><summary>éléments biographiques</summary><p>Basé à Zurich, le danseur et chorégraphe sud-africain Tiran Willemse a étudié à P.A.R.T.S. (Bruxelles) ainsi qu’à la Haute école des arts de Berne (HKB). Sa pratique chorégraphique examine avec précision l’espace, l’imagination, le geste et le son, en interrogeant la manière dont ces éléments participent à la construction du genre et de la mémoire. Tiran a collaboré avec des chorégraphes tels que Trajal Harrell, Jérôme Bel, Wu Tsang, Ligia Lewis, Meg Stuart, Andros Zins-Browne, Eszter Salamon et Deborah Hay. En 2022, il a remporté le Prix suisse de la performance.</p><p>Nkisi est une musicienne et artiste basée à Londres, d’origine congolaise. Elle utilise le rythme, le son et le bruit comme autant de moyens d’activer les traces de mémoire inscrites dans et par le corps en mouvement. À travers des codes sensoriels, elle croise musique, performance et recherche sur des technologies musicales ancestrales, invitant les publics à danser avec l’invisible et à activer des formes incarnées de révolution et de résistance pour le « défaire » et le « refaire » des mondes.</p><p>La recherche de mouvement s’articule autour de structures improvisées permettant une fluidité entre chorégraphie écrite et prises de décision en temps réel. L’approche de Willemse est profondément ancrée dans son exploration continue de la présence, du poids et des dynamiques relationnelles au sein de l’ensemble et avec le public. Le langage physique de la pièce s’inspire à la fois de la club culture, de la danse postmoderne et d’expressions corporelles issues de la diaspora, construisant ainsi un vocabulaire chorégraphique stratifié et dynamique. Au fil de résidences de recherche, Willemse développe des séquences de mouvement en réponse aux paysages sonores de Kolongo, permettant à la chorégraphie d’évoluer en dialogue avec les processus génératifs de la musique en direct. Le travail de répétition explore également l’impact des configurations spatiales sur les relations corporelles, testant différentes proximités et modes d’interaction entre interprètes et spectateur·rice·s.</p><p>Les paysages sonores de Kolongo constituent une composante essentielle de la performance, influençant non seulement l’environnement auditif mais aussi la structure des mouvements et l’expérience du public. Ses compositions mêlent séquences polyrythmiques, éléments percussifs marqués et textures électroniques expérimentales, pour créer une atmosphère immersive et intense. L’improvisation et la performance live occupent une place centrale dans cette dramaturgie sonore. Kolongo développera une partition évolutive capable de s’adapter à différents contextes de présentation – des scènes de festivals en plein air aux espaces intimes d’un théâtre « black box ». L’articulation entre densité sonore, silence et résonance sera déterminante pour définir l’arc global de la pièce.</p></details><div class=gallery><div class=gallery_images><picture id=image-14><source data-srcset=""https://media.ccsparis.com/88761/2__anne_tetzlaff.1600x0.webp 1600w, https://media.ccsparis.com/88761/2__anne_tetzlaff.webp 2x"" type=image/webp><source data-srcset=""https://media.ccsparis.com/88761/2__anne_tetzlaff.1600x0.jpg 1600w, https://media.ccsparis.com/88761/2__anne_tetzlaff.jpg 2x"" type=image/jpeg><img class=""lazyload landscape"" src=https://media.ccsparis.com/88761/2__anne_tetzlaff.300x0.jpg srcset=""https://media.ccsparis.com/88761/2__anne_tetzlaff.600x0.jpg 2x"" width=300 height=200 alt=""Nkisi (Melika Ngombe Kolongo) & Tiran Willemse © Anne Tetzlaff""></picture><a href=#image-15></a><picture id=image-15 style=""left: 100%""><source data-srcset=""https://media.ccsparis.com/88761/1__nkisi_tiran_willemse.512x0.webp 512w, https://media.ccsparis.com/88761/1__nkisi_tiran_willemse.webp 2x"" type=image/webp><source data-srcset=""https://media.ccsparis.com/88761/1__nkisi_tiran_willemse.512x0.jpg 512w, https://media.ccsparis.com/88761/1__nkisi_tiran_willemse.jpg 2x"" type=image/jpeg><img class=""lazyload landscape"" src=https://media.ccsparis.com/88761/1__nkisi_tiran_willemse.300x0.jpg srcset=""https://media.ccsparis.com/88761/1__nkisi_tiran_willemse.600x0.jpg 2x"" width=300 height=300 alt=""© Nkisi (Melika Ngombe Kolongo) & Tiran Willemse""></picture><a href=#image-16 style=""left: 100%""></a><picture id=image-16 style=""left: 200%""><source data-srcset=""https://media.ccsparis.com/88761/3__casper_koeller.540x0.webp 540w, https://media.ccsparis.com/88761/3__casper_koeller.webp 2x"" type=image/webp><source data-srcset=""https://media.ccsparis.com/88761/3__casper_koeller.540x0.jpg 540w, https://media.ccsparis.com/88761/3__casper_koeller.jpg 2x"" type=image/jpeg><img class=""lazyload landscape"" src=https://media.ccsparis.com/88761/3__casper_koeller.300x0.jpg srcset=""https://media.ccsparis.com/88761/3__casper_koeller.600x0.jpg 2x"" width=300 height=300 alt=""Nkisi (Melika Ngombe Kolongo) & Tiran Willemse © Casper Koeller""></picture><a href=#image-17 style=""left: 200%""></a><picture id=image-17 style=""left: 300%""><source data-srcset=""https://media.ccsparis.com/88761/4__nkisi_tiran_willemse.1512x0.webp 1512w, https://media.ccsparis.com/88761/4__nkisi_tiran_willemse.webp 2x"" type=image/webp><source data-srcset=""https://media.ccsparis.com/88761/4__nkisi_tiran_willemse.1512x0.png 1512w, https://media.ccsparis.com/88761/4__nkisi_tiran_willemse.png 2x"" type=image/png><img class=""lazyload landscape"" src=https://media.ccsparis.com/88761/4__nkisi_tiran_willemse.300x0.png srcset=""https://media.ccsparis.com/88761/4__nkisi_tiran_willemse.600x0.png 2x"" width=300 height=195 alt=""© Nkisi (Melika Ngombe Kolongo) & Tiran Willemse""></picture><a href=#image-14 style=""left: 300%""></a> </div><footer class=gallery_footer><div class=gallery_description><p>Nkisi (Melika Ngombe Kolongo) &amp; Tiran Willemse © Anne Tetzlaff</p> </div><div class=gallery_pagination><span class=gallery_current-page>1</span> / 4 </div></footer></div><details class=detail><summary>Partenaire</summary><div class=logos><div class=logo><img src=https://media.ccsparis.com/88692/03_logo_croix_nom_-_copie_1.png style=max-width:52%></div></div></details> </div>"

Yasmine Hugonnet est danseuse et chorégraphe. Elle développe une recherche autour du rapport entre voix, corps et image, mêlant ventriloquie, micro-mouvements et jeux de perception. Son travail explore les états de présence et les processus de transformation du geste, là où les formes circulent entre sensation et langage. Elle s’attache à révéler les zones de passage entre intérieur et extérieur, entre visible et invisible.Partenaires","","<div class=content_center><div class=content_summary><p>Sacs à murmures est une invitation à plonger en famille dans un univers aussi ludique qu’étrange, peuplé de voix mouvantes et de corps métamorphosés.

Ensemble, Lakiko et Laurent créent des espaces sonores poétiques où des mélodies fragiles rencontrent des improvisations éruptives, et où des silences intimes se fondent dans une intensité puissante. Leur jeu s’épanouit comme une conversation — tantôt murmurée, tantôt éclatée — toujours prête à franchir de nouvelles frontières.

éléments biographiquesLakiko
Née à Sarajevo en 1988, Lakiko a étudié à l’Université des Arts de Brême avant de se spécialiser à la Haute école des Arts de Berne. Son projet solo l’a menée dans des festivals renommés tels que le Montreux Jazz Festival, le Cully Jazz Festival et le Jazz Festival de Ljubljana. En 2023, elle a remporté le premier prix des Creative Music Awards en Allemagne, et son premier album What To Do, How To Live? a été désigné comme l’une des surprises classiques de l’année par la Radio et Télévision suisse.
Laurent Nicoud
Le pianiste et compositeur suisse Laurent Nicoud, né à Neuchâtel, navigue avec aisance entre jazz, musique classique et musique improvisée. Son premier album Outline, enregistré à New York en 2020, a été salué par la presse jazz internationale. Depuis, il a publié deux autres albums sous son propre nom. Son langage musical tisse des passerelles entre jazz moderne, influences orientales et traditions classiques européennes, alliant virtuosité technique et ouverture expressive.Partenaires","","<div class=content_center><div class=content_summary><p>Lakiko, violoncelliste, chanteuse et compositrice, et le pianiste et compositeur Laurent Nicoud créent un paysage sonore qui transcende les frontières des genres.

À l’ère des industries numériques mondialisées, l’art numérique se fait espace de résistance, d’espoir et de nouvelles narrations.
Fictions et utopies deviennent des narratifs qui se placent en contre-courant des dystopies de plus en plus réelles dans le présent.  Conçue en collaboration avec la biennale Némo, la plateforme virtuelle ORBIT_E du Musée des Beaux-Arts Le Locle – MBAL (Suisse), la biennale NOVA_XX du Centre Wallonie Bruxelles et le CCS, cette journée propose un programme de projections, rencontres d’artistes et performances pour esquisser des futurs plus désirables.
18:00 – Table ronde : La nature, un environnement utopique pour la création
Avec des artistes de l’exposition Les illusions retrouvées au CENTQUATRE-PARIS :
> Marc Lee, artiste né en 1969, vit et travaille en Suisse.
> Phygital Studio, entreprise incubée à 104factory qui produit des œuvres à la rencontre de la technologie et de la nature, basée à Paris.
> Ismaël Joffroy Chandoutis, né en 1988, vit et travaille entre Paris et Bruxelles.
> NeoConsortium, projet et collectif d’artistes créés en 2014 et basés à Paris.
> Modération par Gilles Alvarez, directeur artistique de la biennale Némo.
19:15 – Table ronde : L’art immatériel dans un monde matériel
> Marta Ponsa, responsable des projets artistiques et de l’action culturelle du Jeu de Paume à Paris.
> Marlene Wenger, curatrice de la Haus der Elektronischen Künste - H.E.K à Bâle en Suisse.
> Kika Nicolela, artiste et curatrice indépendante pour la capsule 2025 de l’ORBIT_E, Le Locle en Suisse.
> Federica Chiocchetti, directrice du Musée des Beaux-Arts Le Locle, Suisse
> Stéphanie Pécourt, directrice du Centre Wallonie-Bruxelles et fondatrice de la biennale NOVA_XX à Paris.
> Modération par Tadeo Kohan, curateur au CCS.
18:00-22:00 – Focus ORBIT_E
Initiée en 2022, la plateforme digitale ORBIT_E est une extension virtuelle en ligne du MBAL qui vient prolonger et compléter la programmation artistique présentée au musée. Pendant cette soirée les œuvres numériques de la plateforme ORBIT_E seront présentées sur des écrans : L’hypnose du Jardin de Lauren Huret, Decompressed Prism de Salvatore Vitale, ssloop.life de Alfatih et Doomscrolling with 5 international artists de Kika Nicolela.
21:00 – Performance de relaxation de Lauren Huret – L’Hypnose du jardin
Conçue à partir de photos de parcs genevois, modifiées et augmentées avec un logiciel d’IA, cette vidéo compose un paradis artificiel apaisant. Entre rêve, hallucination et lenteur, Lauren Huret propose une performance de relaxation autour de son œuvre, comme une hypnose visuelle et guérissante.

C’est un processus de survie ancré dans les murs d’un studio de danse.
I need help immediately est une pièce chorégraphique et multidisciplinaire, construite en dialogue constant avec sa trame musicale complexe. Inspirée par les effets de fragmentation de la postmodernité, la pièce navigue dans un monde disloqué, saturé de stimuli, où le contrôle est sans cesse questionné : quelle liberté avons-nous dans un système qui nous est imposé ?
Adél danse sur le seuil, déplace les frontières du public, créant un espace où la provocation, l’humour et la profondeur sont en étroite proximité. S’inspirant de la culture hyperpop et de la démonologie, l’œuvre canalise l’excès sensoriel en un acte incarné de défi. Le public est invité dans un vortex, un espace où sensation, mouvement et musique convergent, ouvrant un champ de réflexion sur l’existence.

Adél est membre du collectif OuinchOuinch, avec lequel elle effectue une tournée internationale avec leur pièce HappyHype depuis 2022. Avec Salômé Guillemin-Poeuf et Camille Poudret, elle a co-créé Technopagans – tuning your inner cables, présenté au festival de La Bâtie en 2022. En tant qu’interprète, elle a collaboré avec Simone Aughterlony, Ceylan Öztrük, Viktor Szeri, Gergő D.
