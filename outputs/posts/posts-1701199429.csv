The residencies will take place after individual arrangements between February - early May 2024. The results of the residencies will be presented to the public at the annual Vogelklang Soundcamp on 4 and 5 May 2024.
The Vogelklang Soundcamp is a locally and independently organised event which is also linked to a global network of different actors. It aims to explore the behaviour and habitat of our feathered friends through art and creative contributions. The event was inspired by environmentalist and broadcaster Chris Baines and is part of the International Dawn Chorus Day, which he founded. Over the course of the festival weekend, May 6-7, various temporary sound camps around the world will connect to form one global acoustic network. Through the cooperation of all sound camps, including the Vogelklang Soundcamp in the Black Forest, a 24-hour livestream of continuous morning chirping is created. Thus, along the sunrise a worldwide phenomenon can be experienced: the morning song of the birds.
In addition to the 24-hour bird concert produced collectively by the many sound camps, an on-site and transmedia festival programme will take place in the realm of the Vogelklang Soundcamp in the Black Forest. This includes workshops, lectures, installations, performances, etc. – many of which are interactive and designed for participation.
The two residencies are intended to enable artists to develop a project- and theme-related work and to present it at the Vogelklang Soundcamp. During the production process, the artists will be supported by the Global Forest team. Generally, all artistic media that can be realised within the framework of the festival are welcome. The work should show a special perspective on or direct engagement with nature – in particular with birds or topics from this context. Sociopolitical issues can be individually and artistically in focus. At the core of the Vogelklang Soundcamp is the attempt and claim to assign subjectivity to nature and to engage with it as a biopolitical agent.
Both residencies include a rent-free stay at Kunstverein Global, a scholarship of 1000€ per month, the reimbursement of material costs up to max. 500€, the reimbursement of travel costs up to max. 250€, as well as free food and accommodation during the Vogelklang Soundcamp.","","","<div id=block-otm-content class=""block block-system block-system-main-block""><article role=article class=""node node--type-news-calls node--promoted node--view-mode-full""><div class=node__content><div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item""><p>The organisation Kunstverein Global Forest in St. Georgen, Germany is looking to award two project-based, 2-3 month artist residencies for research and artistic production.

Co-funded by the Creative Europe programme, Common Stories is a project that brings together performing arts organisations, artists and audiences to address the dynamic notions of identity and diversity in a changing European society. It is organising 3 Common LABs, one for each year of the project, paying particularly close attention to:
Artistic practices and stories that are underrepresented or absent from our institutions. The relevance of diversity in language, aesthetics and representation.
Public space and visibility. How cities’ architecture and urban policies shape what is valued, made visible and invisible.
Common LAB 2024 will take place:
17-30 June 2024 in Lisbon, Portugal (hosted by Alkantara).
2-15 September 2024 in Maputo, Mozambique (hosted by CulturArte).
14-27 October 2024 in Bobigny, France (hosted by MC93).
28 October - 10 November 2024 in Brussels, Belgium (hosted by Théâtre National Wallonie-Bruxelles).
At the LAB, participants will take part in an exchange programme but also have opportunities to research and pitch their own projects.
The programme covers travel and accommodation and offers a stipend of 80€/day.

The programme will focus on interdisciplinary practice-based researchers from the visual arts, sound arts, media arts, performing arts, architectural, design, maker and hacker communities to develop short term projects in the UmArts research studio and contribute to the UmArts research environment including the Art & AI Working Group.
To be eligible for ARIR the artist must be resident and eligible to work in the European Union.
This residency will create opportunities to develop your research whatever stage you are at. This is a chance to share knowledge within UmArt’s research groups, make connections and develop collaborations for future research. The selected artists will be contracted through UmArts to develop and or produce a new artistic project at the UmArts Research Studio.
In 2024/2025 UmArts are looking for two artists and makers, one for the UmArts ARIR programme and one for the TAIGA ARIR programme:
TAIGA ARIR: UmArts will support one artist researcher in residence through the TAIGA focus area in Art and AI micro-project. The artists will be invited to develop new projects investigating Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning as part of the Art and AI Working Group.
ARIR: UmArts will support a research based artist in a more generalised field of arts practice who will contribute to the UmArts interdisciplinary research environment.
The total time for the residency is 4 weeks. There are two residency periods, one in autumn, and one in the winter: 15 August- 31 September 2024, and 15 January- 28 February 2025.
UmArts offer a studio space at UmArts Research studio at Arts Campus, Umeå Universitet as well as a fee of 42,000 SEK (~3650 EUR), to include all personal expenses.

Because of this, many of Indonesia’s historic brick structures – the Wringin Lawang gate, the Pari Temple, and others – have withstood earthquakes for more than six centuries. In contrast, newer Indonesian buildings made from modern, Western-style brick and mortar have proved catastrophically less resistant to seismic disturbance.
PRAKSIS Residency 26, Bricking It: An Urgent Situation 2024 will draw on Indonesian vernacular knowledge to explore the technology, history, aesthetics and potentials of traditional brick as a sustainable medium. It will take place from 1-30 April 2024 at Samong Haven, a culture and learning centre under development in Sumberkima, north-west Bali. Residency participants will spend a month developing hands-on skills, building background knowledge and testing new concepts using traditional Indonesian brick, and applications are welcomed from any maker or researcher with related art, design, craft or industry knowledge and experience. Specialist input into the residency comes from Indonesian architect Andy Rahman and senior researchers Professor Totok Noerwasito and Dr. I Nyoman Gede Maha Putra, who will make visits to conduct soil testing, lead brickmaking workshops and supervise an actual, small-scale, construction project.
Co-ordinating the residency are An Urgent Situation project initiators PRAKSIS and Oslo-based architect Don Lawrence. This is the fourth episode within the overarching An Urgent Situation residency series, a long-term PRAKSIS project focusing on learning from local Indonesian vernacular technology, design, society and culture to address the impact of tourism on people and the environment.
In addition to a facilitated programme, residents will receive:
Accommodation - this may involve sharing a twin room with one other person.
Three meals a day provided on site - residents can choose to eat elsewhere at their own cost.
A stipend of 5000 NOK (~425 EUR) towards travel and other costs.

Travel and touring are essential to creativity and culture, but they come at a cost. As the urgency of the climate crisis increases, so does the need for our sector to fully understand its touring footprint, and to sustain a means of sharing art which supports our transition to a global low carbon future.
Working with Julie’s Bicycle, this unique programme aims to support performing arts professionals in England, Norway, and Denmark to tackle these challenges head on.
Applications are welcome from venues, touring companies and individuals across a wide range of art forms. You may, for example, be a music or theatre venue that receives touring organisations, a festival, an orchestra, a theatre company, a solo musician, a performing arts producer, or a multidisciplinary arts organisation.
Beginning in February 2024, selected artists and companies (eight based in England, eight based in Denmark, eight based in Norway) will benefit from a three-month interactive online programme exploring key touring challenges, with provocations, frameworks, and practical approaches to reducing their carbon and environmental impacts. Led by Julie’s Bicycle, with input from guest speakers, this online climate leadership course will inspire participants to collaborate with one another to shape concepts that explore new approaches to international touring and collaboration.
Following the online programme, participants will be invited to apply for project funding in partnership with one another to seed fund concepts originating from the programme. Concepts could include, for example, creating artistic content, exploring new models of presentation or distribution, or research and development.

This space can accommodate artists for their research, experimentation and creative work.
Built with respect for tradition and the environment, Don Sen Folo – LAB is about people, considering what they are and what they have. Man must reclaim his history and his territory, and imagine a world where there are no boundaries between people, between Man and Nature, between past and present, between the Living and the Non-Living.
For artists, taking up residency at Don Sen Folo – LAB means seeking to restore a link with the local population and give birth to new shared imaginations.
It’s about putting the artist-citizen-actor back at the heart of society.
GNININI WOMEN is a laboratory for young African choreographers under 35 years of age.
GNININI is an open space set in a territory conducive to exchanges and encounters with local residents. A space where Art is accessible everywhere and to everyone, as a promise, a dream, a gift.
The residency will take place over 2 consecutive months of choreographic work in common spaces (public space) either from 8 January – 3 March 2023 (inclusive) or from 1 April – 26 May 2023 (inclusive).
The residency covers round-trip transportation from your place of residence to the Don Sen Folo-LAB in Bancoumana, Mali. By bus if you come from West Africa, by plane if you come from another African country. It also provides board and lodging for two months at the Don Sen Folo – LAB in Bancoumana, and a work grant of a total of 400,000 CFA francs for the two-month residency.","","","<div id=block-otm-content class=""block block-system block-system-main-block""><article role=article class=""node node--type-news-calls node--promoted node--view-mode-full""><div class=node__content><div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item""><p>In 2020, Don Sen Folo opened an artistic residency, the Don Sen Folo – LAB, on two hectares in the village of Bancoumana, 50 km from Bamako.

It is a platform for research, cultural dialogue, reflection and innovation where participants are invited to meet and confront different points of view about culture and life and discover a new cultural routine based on the concept of togetherness, seen as the quality of working and belonging to a collective practice.
The laboratory aims to foster creativity and interdisciplinarity looking into the future, (re)imagining new ways of performativity, culture and life by creating a space for dialogue, sharing of different artistic practices, exchange and collaboration but also for reflection on (post)war in Europe. Makers from different disciplines, cultural researchers but also experts in biodiversity are invited in a collective co-authorship process, to slow-down their activity and allow time for reflection and experiment, recording emotions and memories of people in relation to nature, city and life.
The laboratory-residency is open to interested mid-career participants with experience in collaborative practices from Austria, Germany, Poland, Romania and Ukraine who are willing to think, reflect and connect with the nature, the city of Bucharest, people’s emotions as well as engaging in a critical thinking process about a greener future. A total number of 8 participants will be invited for 3 weeks to Romania to meet, discuss and develop new ideas and projects on the proposed themes of the residency.
Following a 3-day introductory period at the Black Sea in the middle of the nature, each participant will be invited to lead the group for one day, sharing their own artistic practice, lead conversation and debates, propose films for watching together, experiment and test the concept of togetherness and slowness and what does it mean to create and live nowadays. In the last days of the laboratory-residency, participants will be encouraged to generate in small groups new ideas on the proposed themes. On the last day of the residency, the participants will choose collectively one project idea that was generated during the laboratory. The project selected (including up to 3 participants) will be offered an additional 3-week research time in order to further test and develop the project in October 2024 in a residency in Bucharest at AREAL and Pavilion Goethe Institute.
The residency covers travel costs from the city of residence to Bucharest (return ticket up to 300 Euro/each participant) and accommodation in a shared apartment (with single and twin rooms); a fee of 1000 Euro (gross amount) for the laboratory period in May 2024; a fee of 1000 Euro (gross amount, including per diem) for the additional research 3-week residency in October 2024 (fee per person/ up to 3 participants).","","","<div id=block-otm-content class=""block block-system block-system-main-block""><article role=article class=""node node--type-news-calls node--promoted node--view-mode-full""><div class=node__content><div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item""><p>Performing Togetherness is a new type of laboratory-residency developed by Gabriela Tudor Foundation as a result of the crisis within the cultural sector following the pandemic period and the war in Ukraine.

The selected artist(s) will be offered a residency at iMAL in March/April 2024, under the mentorship of the immersive performance pioneers of CREW Brussels.
How we experience digital content is changing rapidly with the emergence of extended reality, or XR. XR brings together virtual, augmented and mixed reality to create a blended reality in which data seamlessly mingles with the physical environment.
The impact of this new integrated world is becoming evident across society in domains such as education, healthcare, industry and culture. Inevitably, the opportunities XR presents also introduce critical issues relating to sustainability, ethics, data privacy, and unequal access to technology, to name a few examples.
XR tools offer creatives and artists compelling possibilities for building upon and challenging existing modes of content creation and storytelling while helping to develop original methodologies for producing new artistic media.
During the residency at iMAL, Brussels, from 4 March - 28 April 2024, the selected applicant(s) will receive access to its XR LAB, which contains state-of-the-art equipment for creating and producing XR projects, as well as curatorial and production support. The selected resident(s) will also be provided with guidance and special mentorship by CREW and have the opportunity to work with different motion capture systems, a variety of VR HMDs (stand-alone and PC-based), trackers, video projectors, 3D scanners, as well as full pipelines of audio and video equipment, adapted to the needs of XR. The entire process will be supported by an array of high end gaming computers and network equipment.
Towards the end of the residency, a public event will be held at which the resident(s) will present the resulting work.
A budget of €9350 will be provided to cover fee (€2000); development and production (€3000); accommodation and subsistence (€3750); and travel (€600).
The call is open to all emerging creatives who are European residents.","","","<div id=block-otm-content class=""block block-system block-system-main-block""><article role=article class=""node node--type-news-calls node--promoted node--view-mode-full""><div class=node__content><div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item""><p>The iMAL space in Brussels is launching a second call for XR artistic projects in the context of the Realities in Transition project.

Regardless of what you do, if you are concerned about our digital rights and the lack of agency over the platforms and devices we use, CODE 2024 are looking for you.
With this open call they invite creatives, professional and non-professional artists, and concerned citizens living in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany to embark on a six-month journey of dialogue, critical discussion, and co-creation about digital rights. Between January and June 2024 you will work with other participants on group artworks to be presented at international festivals and events.
CODE was initiated in 2021 as a response to growing concerns that we are losing agency over the digital tools and platforms we use on a daily basis. The organisers believe in the need for better laws and legislation that will protect us as digital citizens and consumers. By creating creative and artistic interventions, their aim is to influence public policy on a national and international level and to create awareness for issues at hand.
Selected participants will work closely together in a co-creation process. CODE consists of a series of online and onsite events, including:
Kickoff meeting (online).
Three workshops (hybrid).
One symposium (online).
2-3-day hackathon (onsite).
Group meetings and feedback sessions (both online and onsite).
Online exhibition.
Presentations at festivals and events.
The events are spread over several months: from late January till June, with presentations of the project’s outcome expected in September. Group artworks will also be conceived over the six-month period from January to June.
There is a small stipend for groups that produce a work for international presentations and for the online exhibition.

The scheme is composed of two action lines:
Individual mobility for artists and cultural professionals.
Residencies for host organisations.
This call is addressed to residency hosts that are legal entities based in one of the 40 Creative Europe countries. The purpose of the grant is to welcome international artists and cultural professionals at your premises to implement a residency project. The participating artists and cultural professionals must be legal residents in a Creative Europe country that is different from the host’s country.
Residency hosts should be active in one or more of the following sectors:
Architecture.
Cultural heritage.
Design and fashion design.
Literature.
Music.
Performing arts.
Visual arts.
What is the residency action for?
You can apply for funding for a residency project with a proposal that includes its objectives, expected impact and duration. You will act as a mentor to artists and cultural professionals, and should provide them with the environment, support and equipment adapted to their field of expertise, so that they can focus on their individual or collective projects.
The residency project should pursue one or two of the following objectives:
To explore: To conduct research, to investigate and work on a specific theme or a new concept.
To create: To engage in a collective creative process seeking to produce a new piece of artistic/cultural work.
To learn: To enhance the participants’ competences through non-formal learning or collaboration with a specialist.
To connect: To develop a network, to strengthen the participants’ professional development.
To transform: To enable societal change in line with the New European Bauhaus values and principles.
You can welcome between 1 and 5 international artists and cultural professionals who must all participate in the residency project on the same dates and for the same duration. The residency can last between 22 and 300 days.
When applying, you must choose one of the following durations:
Short-term residency project: between 22 and 60 days.
Medium-term residency project: between 61 and 120 days.
Long-term residency project: between 121 and 300 days.
Support
The residency grant contributes to the costs connected to hosting international artists and cultural professionals and their mobility. This includes housing costs (fixed €35 per day), a mobility grant covering a travel allowance (€350 for distances between 601-5000km, €700 for 5001km+) and daily allowance (€25 per day), and various top-up allowances that support green travel and the participation of Overseas Countries and Territories or Outermost Regions, disabled artists and professionals, persons with children below the age of 10, and those with visa expenses.
Timeline
Selected residency projects must be carried out and completed within 1 year from the signature of the grant agreement.
Culture Moves Europe’s residency action is offering 4 open calls between spring 2023 and autumn 2024. This second call is open from 16 October 2023 to 16 January 2024.

Anhar: Culture and Climate Platform is designed specifically to diversify and increase support for practitioners in the Arab world and builds on findings and key priorities that emerged through the Culture and Climate Summit, a two-day workshop and seminar exploring culture’s role in addressing the climate emergency, jointly organised by Art Jameel and the British Council in March 2023.
The Anhar selection process will see expert juries consider proposals from individual practitioners making new work and instigating community projects through to large-scale international collaborations, via grassroots institutions actioning practical solutions to reduce their carbon footprint.
Anhar: Culture and Climate Platform kicks off with a three-tiered open call that invites individual artists, collectives and cultural organisations based in eligible countries in the MENA region to submit proposals that meaningfully engage with the climate emergency.
The programme aims to:
Support creative practitioners producing cultural projects that engage with the climate emergency, raise awareness and inspire engagement.
Support cultural organisations in refitting spaces for energy efficiency and renewable energy use and/or the implementation of processes aimed at tracking and reducing carbon emissions and waste.
Support experimental and creative approaches to cultural production that centre local, community-based and intersectional perspectives.
Facilitate peer exchange, stimulate meaningful connections, international and interdisciplinary collaboration while expanding and strengthening a regional network of cultural practitioners engaged with the climate emergency.
There are three award tiers:
Tier 1: Awards grants of £1000 to £5000 ($1000 to $6000) to individual artists and collectives working on climate-related projects and proposals.
Tier 2: Awards grants of £5000 to £10000 ($6000 to $12,000) to cultural organisations to reduce their carbon and waste footprint through the development and implementation of a decarbonisation strategy, including material works and investments in renewable energy infrastructures.
Tier 3: Awards grants of £25,000 to £50,000 ($30,500 to $70,000) to support collaborations between UK and MENA artists, collectives, networks and/or cultural organisations seeking to develop a large-scale artistic response to the climate emergency, with at least a component of the project taking place in a MENA country.

The next edition will take place 15 & 16 June 2024.
Displacement and flight – two themes present since the very first edition of Danse élargie – seem more necessary than ever in our current world shaken by the solemnity of war, the rise of extremisms and the hardening of implacable positions. If the age is one of weightiness, Danse élargie remains a zone of freedom where the artists of today – and tomorrow – defy gravity, invent new ways of dancing and take the liberty to mix spices from all latitudes. Danse élargie is a dance competition that celebrates every yen for movement.
At roughly the same time, in 2024, Paris will host the 33rd Olympic and Paralympic Games: the chance for a convivial gathering devoted to hospitality. After seven years away (during renovation to the theatre), Danse élargie will once again be held in its original premises, at Place du Châtelet, to transform the legendary stage into a playground for performance, into a tournament with neither battles nor clashes.
Projects entered for the competition must feature at least 3 performers on stage, and must not exceed 10 minutes in length. Between 15 and 20 candidates will be selected to present in Paris.
Each Finalist will receive a fixed sum of 2000€ as a contribution towards the costs incurred by their participation in the competition (accommodation, travel, studio rental…).

As one part of its programme of activities, European Digital Deal is now calling on artists interested in exploring the deep entanglement between new technologies and democracy to apply for one of 12 residencies. Each of the 12 residencies is linked to one consortium partner:
Ars Electronica (AT).
Gluon (BE).
Kersnikova Institute (SI).
LABoral (ES).
Onassis Stegi (EL).
Pro Progessione (HU).
Sineglossa (IT).
Center for the Promotion of Science (CPN)(RS).
The Culture Yard (DK).
Waag (NL) is offering 2 residencies.
Zaragoza City of Knowledge Foundation (FZC) / Etopia (ES).
Artists are invited to investigate a range of topics, from the notion of truth in the information age shaped by algorithms, biases in AI, techno-anxiety, and the digital divides arising as a result of digitalisation to new forms of surveillance, intelligence, living, citizenship, or work.
Eligibility:
Individual artists or duos/groups/collectives.
Artists that have produced enough artworks for the jury to assess their artistic experience. Previous experience collaborating with companies and/or research institutions will be valued but is not a condition for participation.
Citizens or permanent residents of all EU and non-EU countries.
The selected artists will receive a 25,000 EUR grant to complete their project, the support of the group of experts around each residency, access to mentorship through an incubation programme, and the chance to show their work at Ars Electronica Festival, Onassis Stegi, and Laboral among many other locations.","","","<div id=block-otm-content class=""block block-system block-system-main-block""><article role=article class=""node node--type-news-calls node--promoted node--view-mode-full""><div class=node__content><div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item""><p>European Digital Deal is a three-year investigation co-funded by Creative Europe into how the accelerated, yet at times unconsidered adoption of new technologies – such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain and algorithmic processing – can alter or undermine democratic processes.</p><p>As one part of its programme of activities, European Digital Deal is now calling on artists interested in exploring the deep entanglement between new technologies and democracy to apply for one of 12 residencies.

The scholarship is addressed to playwrights living in Europe who have already written at least one theatre play that has been staged already. The working scholarship is intended to enable them to write a play on a socially relevant, European topic with financial security. A jury of five decides on the award of the scholarship.
The resulting works should be in the tradition of Zuckmayer’s cosmopolitan spirit and shed new light on his thematic fields such as homeland, exile, resistance and the genre of the critical folk play in a European present. The Staatstheater Mainz, which frequently collaborates with playwrights for world premieres, will organise the tendering process and accompany the playwrights in their development.
The theatre festival PLUG&PLAY at the Staatstheater Mainz, with its focus on young directors, sees itself as a lively working forum, meeting place and open space for exchange about contemporary theatre. It thus provides the ideal setting for the annual public awarding of the scholarship as well as a reading of the previous year’s play within the festival programme. The first awarding of the Carl Zuckmayer Scholarship will take place on 09 May 2024 at the opening of the PLUG&PLAY Festival.
The scholarship includes:
10,000 EUR grant.
Supervision by the dramaturgy of the Staatstheater Mainz
Assumption of the costs for travel and accommodation for a maximum of three stays in Mainz (by arrangement).
Option of the world premiere of the play at the Staatstheater Mainz.","","","<div id=block-otm-content class=""block block-system block-system-main-block""><article role=article class=""node node--type-news-calls node--promoted node--view-mode-full""><div class=node__content><div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item""><p>In 2023, the Ministry of the State of Rhineland-Palatinate will for the first time award the Carl Zuckmayer Scholarship to promote contemporary European drama and the memory of the political German playwright Carl Zuckmayer.</p><p>The scholarship is addressed to playwrights living in Europe who have already written at least one theatre play that has been staged already.
