Pour cette nouvelle édition, TGM Gallery invite les artistes émergents à explorer les années 1990, une décennie charnière, prise entre la fin d’un siècle et l’aube de l’ère numérique.

Il ne s’agit pas de nostalgie, mais de réinterprétation :- En quoi les années 1990 résonnent-elles encore aujourd’hui ?- Quelles formes artistiques peuvent émerger de cette mémoire collective ? - Comment les artistes contemporains peuvent-ils rejouer, subvertir ou transformer cette décennie à la lumière des enjeux actuels ? Ce concours d’arts visuels est ouvert, sur dossier, à tous les jeunes artistes et passionnés d’art.Chaque candidat peut soumettre une, deux ou trois œuvres en lien avec le thème ""90’s Reloaded"".Les œuvres proposées peuvent relever de toute discipline des arts visuels, incluant (sans s’y limiter) : peinture, sculpture, dessin, installation, photographie, vidéo, arts numériques, ou techniques mixtes. Le dossier de candidature devra comprendre :- Les coordonnées complètes du candidat (CV, adresse e-mail, numéro de téléphone) ;- Un portfolio de 5 à 10 œuvres récentes ;- Une note d’intention d’une page en lien avec le thème ;- Une fiche contenant les visuels, une description du projet proposé, les spécifications techniques et les détails complets de l’œuvre. Critères d’éligibilité :- Les artistes émergents n’ayant jamais exposé. Les artistes ayant participé aux éditions précédentes ne sont pas éligibles ;- L’œuvre proposée doit être adaptée à une exposition en galerie ;- Les candidatures ne respectant pas le thème seront automatiquement rejetées.

بالنسبة للمعاضيد، شعرت أن توقيت إطلاق مجوهرات لولوة كان مناسبًا تمامًا. مستوحاة من التراث الثقافي القطري الغني، وخاصة صناعة اللؤلؤ التاريخية، تصورت علامة تجارية يمكنها أن تمزج بسلاسة بين الزخارف التقليدية والتصاميم المعاصرة. وأوضحت قائلة: ""استُلهمت مجوهرات لولوة من التراث القطري الغني وتاريخ صناعة اللؤلؤ في البلاد""، مضيفة: ""تسعى علامتي التجارية للمجوهرات إلى مزج الزخارف التقليدية مع التصميم المعاصر. في عام 2024، شعرت أن الوقت قد حان للتعبير عن شغفي بالمجوهرات وإنشاء قطع تحكي قصة فريدة وتعبر عن الذات."" في سوق غالبًا ما يكون مشبعًا بالاتجاهات العالمية، تهدف مجوهرات لولوة إلى ملء فراغ فريد من خلال تقديم قطع تهمس بحكايات الهوية القطرية وتتردد صداها بإحساس بالتعبير الفردي.
الاسم نفسه، ""مجوهرات لولوة""، يتحدث عن الكثير. صرحت المعاضيد قائلة: ""'مجوهرات لولوة' استُلهمت من اسمي ويعكس مهنة عائلية أردت إحياءها."" كان جدها، وهو تاجر لؤلؤ يحظى باحترام كبير، يفهم بعمق القيمة الجوهرية للؤلؤ القطري وكان ""يحظى باحترام كبير داخل المجتمع القطري."" هذا الإرث ليس مجرد حاشية تاريخية؛ بل يشكل الركيزة الأساسية لأخلاقيات العلامة التجارية وجماليات التصميم. يمكن للمرء أن يتخيل الثقل والعجب المرتبطين بمثل هذا التراث، ومن الواضح أن المعاضيد تعتزم تكريم هذا الماضي من خلال نسج جوهره في إبداعاتها. لا شك أن القصص والذكريات المحددة المرتبطة بهذا التراث تجد طريقها إلى مجموعاتها، حيث تحمل كل قطعة صدى صامت لأجيال مضت.
مجوهرات لولوة هي أكثر من مجرد مشروع تجاري بالنسبة للمعاضيد؛ إنها مسعى شخصي عميق، مرتبط جوهريًا بذكريات عزيزة وروابط عائلية. تروي لحظة مؤثرة قائلة: ""كنت أنظر ذات مرة إلى صورة قديمة لجدي وهو يفحص أنواعًا مختلفة من اللؤلؤ مع تجار آخرين. سألت والدي الراحل عن الصورة وروى لي بعض القصص عن شغف جدي وكيف تواصل مع مختلف الأشخاص داخل صناعة اللؤلؤ."" على الرغم من أنها لم توضح صراحة كيف تترجم هذه الذاكرة المحددة إلى تصميم معين، فمن الواضح أن مثل هذه اللحظات الشخصية تغذي العملية الإبداعية، وتضفي على القطع طبقة من العاطفة تتجاوز مجرد الجماليات.
إن الشروع في رحلة إحياء إرث عائلي هو طريق مرصوف بالإلهام العميق والتحديات الفريدة على حد سواء. بالنسبة للمعاضيد، ""كان أعظم مكافأة طموحة بالنسبة لي هو إحياء إبداعاتي من خلال إضافة مزيج من التاريخ والثقافة إلى التصاميم الحديثة."" وتضيف موضحة الإلهام وراء إبداعاتها قائلة: ""إبداعاتي مرتبطة بعنصرين طبيعيين مهمين هما الشمس والبحر، وهما بالنسبة لي مصدر الحياة.""
بالنظر إلى المستقبل، تتصور المعاضيد أن تعمق مجوهرات لولوة ارتباطها بالتراث القطري. وتصرح قائلة: ""أود دمج المزيد من التراث القطري في تصميماتي واستخدام مجموعة متنوعة من المواد الغنية جدًا الأصلية في المنطقة."" هدفها واضح: ""هدفي هو إلقاء الضوء على تراثي الجميل وهويتي الثقافية من خلال مزج هذه العوامل مع تفسيرات معاصرة."" يعد هذا النهج المستقبلي، بينما يرتكز على الماضي، بتطور مثير للعلامة التجارية، وربما يستكشف تعاونات فريدة واستخدامات مبتكرة للموارد الإقليمية.
بالنسبة لأولئك الذين يصادفون مجوهرات لولوة للمرة الأولى، تأمل المعاضيد أن يدركوا القيم الأساسية للعلامة التجارية والسرد المقنع وراء إنشائها. ""القيم التي تحملها علامتي التجارية للمجوهرات والقصة وراءها بما في ذلك أهمية التراث القطري،"" هي العناصر الأساسية التي تأمل أن يتردد صداها. لذلك، تقف مجوهرات لولوة كأكثر من مجرد زينة؛ إنها شهادة قابلة للارتداء على القوة الدائمة للإرث العائلي، والفخر الثقافي، والجمال الخالد لتاريخ اللؤلؤ في قطر، أعيد تصوره لعالم معاصر.

Proposal deadline for general submissions: August 31, 2025
The Ammerman Center at Connecticut College seeks submissions for its 2026 Symposium on Arts and Technology being held March 26–28, 2026, at Connecticut College. The aim of the Symposium, celebrating its 40th anniversary, is to create an inclusive forum for multidisciplinary dialogues, exhibitions and performances at the intersection of arts, technology, and contemporary culture.
What is the Arts and Technology symposium, and what makes it unique?
As much a media-arts festival as it is an academic symposium, the event functions as a creative, interdisciplinary retreat, mixing up to 100 outside participants of wildly different backgrounds with our own faculty and students at our beautiful campus-arboretum, halfway between Boston and NYC. We strongly emphasize having no passive observers: all participants tend to also present in some venue throughout the weekend, and we work to create multiple formal and informal spaces for conversation, creative exchange and interaction.
Participants, selected via an open call, come from all backgrounds, with a mix of those fully based in academia as well as emerging, independent and local artists, supported via our participation grants. They come from across the region and the country as well as internationally.
Our keynote speaker will be Katerina Cizek, Artistic Director, Co-Founder and Executive Producer of the Co-Creation Studio at MIT Open Documentary Lab. The Symposium will feature presentations from several multi-disciplinary works commissioned by the Ammerman Center over the past year, alongside panel discussions and paper presentations, workshops, artist talks, gallery exhibitions, music and sound concerts, installations, screenings, public interventions and live performances.

SYMPOSIUM THEME: ALL TOO HUMAN
What does it mean at this particular moment and place to be human, more-than-human, or within the spectrum between? What is the state of humanistic ideals in our precarious techno-political landscape? Scientific and technological advances affect bodies–as extensions, prostheses, knowledge producers, resistance, and beyond. This year’s theme seeks to read the human with and against the grain using arts and technology as potent vectors of inquiry.
“All Too Human” centers the Human and troubles its boundaries: it seeks definition into what is essential to the human, how humanness unites communities, yet also divides through xenophobia. It engages with the state of Humanism as a philosophy, and the challenges to it. How do technology and techno-optimism collide or collaborate with Humanism? How do we remain humanistic in the face of extreme strife, from authoritarian rule, to climate crisis, war, and automation? Who gets to decide what or who is human, and how are technological and representational systems implicated in this process?
“All Too Human” considers the Non-Human: it expresses the aspirations, anxieties and critical thought over the non-human as it becomes more powerful, autonomous, and generative. Is there a point at which technological agents could be considered human? What would other forms be that these agents could take that stretch or disrupt our understanding of what humanity is? As we grow more aware, through old and new ways of knowing, of the agency of non-humans from plants to animals to fungi, where are the lines drawn? And what is the role of art and technology in catalyzing and criticizing all of the above?
“All Too Human” is simultaneously strength and precarity; it gets at the heart of collective knowledge and collaboration as much as it considers radical individualism. To be human, all too human, is to be creative, generative, and in conversation with those around you and a larger, globalized experience.
We seek:
Papers: 15 minute presentations of scholarly work, theory, artist talks, and more.
Panels: set of 3-4 presenters together; otherwise we will curate panels out of submitted talks
Workshops: technology focused crash-courses, work-in-process feedback or participation, or art/social practice based activities
Music and sound performances
Artwork in all old and new media for the symposium exhibition: including site-specific interventions and performances and experimental design.
Performing arts: Dance, Theater, and Performance Art
Single channel screen-based work: Video, Film, and Animation (for exhibition or evening screenings)
Demo/poster tables: works in progress or completed
Lightning talks: brief, 5-8 artist talks, works in progress or completed
See below for details on each of these areas, and the Resources page on our website for the available support and spaces for each.
In our continuing efforts toward equity, diversity, and collaboration in the field, and how the fields of arts and technology are shifting in the 21st century, scholars and artists from underrepresented communities and early career practitioners from the northeast region are especially encouraged to apply, including independent artists, scholars, and adjuncts. Available funding will be prioritized to support such applicants. Registration will be available on a sliding scale, with several full participation and travel grants available (see below).
SUBMISSIONS
For information on venue specifications and technical capabilities, see our Resource and Venue Information Page.
All submissions must be completed on our website. If you cannot use a Google account, please email requisite material described below to cat@conncoll.edu with subject line “Symposium Submission.” Some submissions may be recommended for alternative forms of presentation depending upon material and curatorial necessity, to be communicated and discussed between those who submit and the conference committee.

This category includes scholarly work and reports on research, theory, or artwork, artist talks, and position papers raising original and provocative theoretical or practical discourses and questions. The default duration of all paper presentations and talks is 15 minutes. Papers may be submitted independently or as a group submitting a full panel (see above).
Additional required information: two-page extended abstract or complete paper, upon acceptance, a revised 4-8 page paper must be submitted as a PDF in provided format for publication in the Symposium Proceedings. All rights will remain with the author. Paper authors will give 15 minute oral presentations during the paper sessions.
WORKSHOPS
Technology, Project-based and Participatory, or Work-in-progress sharing
Technology demonstrations and hands-on workshop submissions in all forms of media are welcome. For demonstrations or workshops we assume that the presenters will provide the necessary equipment and materials. The Ammerman Center will be able to provide classroom space and a limited selection of tools and hardware. Duration of the workshop is flexible and can be negotiated with the Symposium coordinators.
Technology workshops: These could include presentation of approaches to creative and experimental uses of technology or skill shares.
Project-based / Participatory workshops: Opportunities for demonstrations of work and collaborative / participatory project development.
Work-in-Progress sharing: Demonstrations can be part of specific projects and could be formatted to solicit feedback from the audience. Multiple presentations in a single session serve to connect practitioners and encourage engagement and collaboration at all stages of development.
Some submissions may be recommended for this type of presentation depending upon material and curatorial necessity, to be communicated and discussed between those who submit and the conference committee.
Additional required information: optional extended description including goals and duration (pdf); a technical rider (pdf) as needed to include: materials and tools supplied by the presenter, complete technical needs from the Ammerman Center including workspace, seating, tools, software/hardware, lighting, power, and all other requirements.
DEMO / POSTER TABLES
We invite display tables of creative and/or research praxis as part of a session with a number of other presenters. Presenters will be able to engage with questions and feedback in a designated session, and engagement throughout the Symposium is also possible. This is a useful opportunity to develop new work, work in progress, or as a conclusion/demonstration of a past work. It is expected that materials and tools are supplied by the presenter. Some submissions may be recommended for this type of presentation depending upon material and curatorial necessity, to be communicated and discussed between those who submit and the conference committee.
Additional required information: none, optional extended description / tech requirements may be included
.
LIGHTNING TALKS
This set of brief (5-8 minute) presentations is for feedback and discussion of work. All types of presentations are welcome. This is a useful opportunity to develop new work, work in progress, or as a conclusion/demonstration of a past work. Several talks will be groups as one event.
Some submissions may be recommended for this type of presentation depending upon material and curatorial necessity, to be communicated and discussed between those who submit and the conference committee.
Additional required information: supporting media based on the proposed presentation (images / audio / video etc).
MUSIC AND SOUND PERFORMANCES
Music and sound submissions could take many forms including: work for live instruments with electronic sounds and/or digital media, voice, interactive performances, live laptop improvisations, customized or hand-made electronics, or electronic sounds alone (fixed media). All works representative of any of the rich array of approaches, styles, and media possible within electroacoustic musics are welcome.
Works under 12 minutes will receive preference.
Pianist available to perform submitted pieces.
Additional required information: sample audio / video materials, optional extended (1 page or less) description, technical rider with: complete technical, equipment and performance needs, what the artist will provide (i.e. laptop with customized software, hand-made electronics), indication of who will be performing (artist, additional musician/performer, fixed media playback), and accompanying scores/recordings as appropriate.
EXHIBITION and INTERVENTIONS
Potential media includes: 2D and 3D objects, responsive environments, bio-art, kinetics, audio, video, net.art, AR/VR and hybrid installations, Performance Art, Social-Practice Art, as well as socio-eco design including experimental architecture and environmental interventions. Works that challenge disciplinary boundaries are specifically encouraged. A series of smaller works may be considered as one submission.
Single channel screen-based work should be submitted through its own category, and may be shown either in one of the exhibition venues or in one of our evening programs. See below.
Sound work: may be submitted either to the exhibition or to the listening program in one of our concert events.
Selected works will be presented in a group exhibition or as pop-up installations / interventions / performances at any of the following venues (artists may indicate their interest in these in their application):
Main venue–the Arts and Technology Gallery at Cummings: large (roughly 100 x 100 foot) open shared “pop-up” exhibition space in the first floor of the Cummings Art Center (see photos). Duration: 1 month.
Pop-up installations / exhibits – JTC Atrium Gallery at Cummings and additional spaces throughout the Art Center (the main venue for the symposium). Duration: 3 days (the symposium weekend) or longer based on availability and viability.
Outdoors location / elsewhere on campus (including our arboretum) maybe possible for site specific proposals pending approval of relevant entities, as long as installation is undertaken by the artist.
Projection mapping: We’re interested in proposals for site-specific projection mapping work, for which we can provide a 7000 Lumens laser projector and a PA system. The work should engage with particular surfaces on campus – in particular those of Cummings Art Center or Palmer Auditorium.
Complex projects may be presented in a paper and/or panel presentation, with a smaller accompanying work in the exhibition.
Installation of selected work is the artist’s responsibility. We will provide technical assistance for primarily safety or heavy equipment related issues, and may provide some additional installation help as available.
Shipping is the artists’ responsibility, although a small budget is available for return shipping of small items.
Additional required information: dimensions and/or duration, media details, technical rider if needed, sample digital materials, shipping needed.
PERFORMING ARTS: DANCE, THEATER, AND PERFORMANCE ART
Dance compositions, theater works, and performance art pieces that incorporate technologies in meaningful ways are being solicited for performances, live demonstrations, or digitally recorded presentations.
Also of interest are proposals for workshops, demonstrations of software for dance or theater notation, choreographic analysis, interactive studies and/or multimedia studies of performance in dance and theater–see the appropriate submission categories for each (i.e Papers, Workshops and Demos, etc). Acceptance of performances will depend on financial considerations as well as technical and space needs.
Works under 15 minutes will receive preference.

The aim of the Symposium, celebrating its 40th anniversary, is to create an inclusive forum for multidisciplinary dialogues, exhibitions and performances at the intersection of arts, technology, and contemporary culture. </p><p>What is the Arts and Technology symposium, and what makes it unique?</p><p>As much a media-arts festival as it is an academic symposium, the event functions as a creative, interdisciplinary retreat, mixing up to 100 outside participants of wildly different backgrounds with our own faculty and students at our beautiful campus-arboretum, halfway between Boston and NYC. We strongly emphasize having no passive observers: all participants tend to also present in some venue throughout the weekend, and we work to create multiple formal and informal spaces for conversation, creative exchange and interaction. </p><p>Participants, selected via an open call, come from all backgrounds, with a mix of those fully based in academia as well as emerging, independent and local artists, supported via our participation grants. They come from across the region and the country as well as internationally.</p><p>Our keynote speaker will be Katerina Cizek, Artistic Director, Co-Founder and Executive Producer of the Co-Creation Studio at MIT Open Documentary Lab. The Symposium will feature presentations from several multi-disciplinary works commissioned by the Ammerman Center over the past year, alongside panel discussions and paper presentations, workshops, artist talks, gallery exhibitions, music and sound concerts, installations, screenings, public interventions and live performances.</p><p><a href=https://artsandtechsymposium.digital.conncoll.edu/ target=_blank>Symposium 2026 Site</a><br><a href=https://artsandtechsymposium.digital.conncoll.edu/submission-form/ target=_blank>Symposium 2026 Submission Form</a></p><p><strong>SYMPOSIUM THEME: ALL TOO HUMAN</strong></p><p>What does it mean at this particular moment and place to be human, more-than-human, or within the spectrum between? What is the state of humanistic ideals in our precarious techno-political landscape? Scientific and technological advances affect bodies–as extensions, prostheses, knowledge producers, resistance, and beyond. This year’s theme seeks to read the human with and against the grain using arts and technology as potent vectors of inquiry. </p><p>“All Too Human” centers the Human and troubles its boundaries: it seeks definition into what is essential to the human, how humanness unites communities, yet also divides through xenophobia. It engages with the state of Humanism as a philosophy, and the challenges to it. How do technology and techno-optimism collide or collaborate with Humanism? How do we remain humanistic in the face of extreme strife, from authoritarian rule, to climate crisis, war, and automation? Who gets to decide what or who is human, and how are technological and representational systems implicated in this process?</p><p>“All Too Human” considers the Non-Human: it expresses the aspirations, anxieties and critical thought over the non-human as it becomes more powerful, autonomous, and generative. Is there a point at which technological agents could be considered human? What would other forms be that these agents could take that stretch or disrupt our understanding of what humanity is? As we grow more aware, through old and new ways of knowing, of the agency of non-humans from plants to animals to fungi, where are the lines drawn? And what is the role of art and technology in catalyzing and criticizing all of the above?</p><p>“All Too Human” is simultaneously strength and precarity; it gets at the heart of collective knowledge and collaboration as much as it considers radical individualism. To be human, all too human, is to be creative, generative, and in conversation with those around you and a larger, globalized experience.</p><p>We seek:</p><p> Papers: 15 minute presentations of scholarly work, theory, artist talks, and more.<br> Panels: set of 3-4 presenters together; otherwise we will curate panels out of submitted talks<br> Workshops: technology focused crash-courses, work-in-process feedback or participation, or art/social practice based activities<br> Music and sound performances<br> Artwork in all old and new media for the symposium exhibition: including site-specific interventions and performances and experimental design.<br> Performing arts: Dance, Theater, and Performance Art<br> Single channel screen-based work: Video, Film, and Animation (for exhibition or evening screenings)<br> Demo/poster tables: works in progress or completed<br> Lightning talks: brief, 5-8 artist talks, works in progress or completed</p><p>See below for details on each of these areas, and the Resources page on our website for the available support and spaces for each.</p><p>In our continuing efforts toward equity, diversity, and collaboration in the field, and how the fields of arts and technology are shifting in the 21st century, scholars and artists from underrepresented communities and early career practitioners from the northeast region are especially encouraged to apply, including independent artists, scholars, and adjuncts.

COMEL Award Vanna Migliorin Contemporary Art
Aluminium, the silent strength
From October 18 to November 8, 2025
CALL FOR SUBMISSION X EDITIONT
The COMEL Vanna Migliorin Contemporary Art Award (hereafter “COMEL Award”) was
established in 2012 in memory of Mrs. Vanna Migliorin, for her passion for art and enthusiasm
for supporting innovative projects. In 1968 with her husband Mazzola Alfonso, she founded in
Latina the CO.ME.L. Commercio Metalli Latina (today COMEL Industries), a leading company in
the trade and processing of semi-finished aluminium products that promotes and supports the
COMEL award in a brilliant example of synergy between art and business.
A well-established reality in the modern art scene, among the most innovative European
competitions. A project, now at its 10th edition, that promotes, in addition, intercultural
relations between the countries of the European continent, creates moments of sharing and
meeting between artists, scholars, and the public.
Participation in the call for entries is free and open to artists aged 18 and older who use
aluminium as the main element in the creation of the work they intend to enter in the
competition. At each edition, a high-level jury selects, from all entries received, the 13 finalist
works that will be exhibited in Latina, in the Spazio COMEL Arte Contemporanea gallery
(www.spaziocomel.it ), the exclusive venue of the event. The winner will be awarded the Jury
Award, while the public visiting the exhibition will be asked to vote for their favourite works by
decreeing the winner of the Audience Award.
With a view to a planned and effective promotion of the participants and the Award itself, a
catalogue will be prepared by the organization on the occasion of the exhibition and targeted
dissemination in specialized media. In addition, the finalist artists will be given an interview
about their artistic experience. An important testimony that will become part of the portfolio
of the Award website. The COMEL award will be fully responsible for the care of the catalogue
and communication.
WHY ALUMINIUM?
Aluminium can be forged, modeled, laminated, like hot wax in the artist’s hands. It lends itself to
take on the desired forms and volumes. It is lightweight (a third of steel), shiny, soft, durable, with
good electrical and thermal conductivity, 100% recyclable with an energy cost equal to one
twentieth of that necessary for its first melting. Visually intriguing, with its unique characteristics,
aluminium is the true contemporary material.
WHY 13 ARTISTS?
Because in the Table of Elements, aluminium is the chemical element with the atomic number 13.
ART. 1 – OBJECTIVES AND AIMS OF THE COMEL AWARD 2025
The 2025 COMEL Award aims at:
1. promoting Contemporary Art and the intercultural relationships among the European
countries;
2. strenghtening the link between Contemporary Art and business;
3. enhancing the value of aluminium, its expressive, aesthetic, communicative and constructive
possibilities;
4. establishing a vital and significant relationship between the public and the artists.
ART. 2 – TITLE OF THE COMEL AWARD 2025
Not he who begins, but he who perseveres.
Leonardo da Vinci (plaque mounted on the Amerigo Vespucci ship)
ALUMINIUM, THE SILENT STRENGHT
Aluminium, with its lightness, its great ductility, may appear to be a fragile material. Instead, it
hides an unexpected strength. Its resistance, often underestimated, emerges with
surprising evidence when it is moulded into bold shapes and imposing structures. It could be
said that like the human being, aluminium is capable of withstanding challenges and
adapting to change, finding new structures and new forms of balance.
The theme of the 2025 edition of the COMEL award invites artists to investigate the
hidden qualities of aluminium, exploring its ability to resist, to sustain, to last. The artists are
called upon to use metal as a metaphor for human resilience, the ability to overcome difficulties
and find inner strength even in moments of fragility.
Aluminium thus becomes a symbol of silent strength, a discreet but powerful resistance,
which manifests itself through the creativity and ingenuity of the artists.
ART. 3 – CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION
Participation in the competition is free. There are no age limits and it is open to all artists, 18
years of age and older, of any European nationality as far as they use aluminium as the main

Open Call: The Art of Climate Communication
Exhibition 10.10.2025 – 21.11.2025
How can I win people over to climate protection? The climate crisis is the biggest challenge of our time – and yet many people feel powerless to prevent it. How can we address the issue of global warming without overwhelming people? How can we reach people, touch them and motivate them to act?
Climate communication is key to shaping change. It should motivate people to act, engage them and win over old and new target groups for climate protection. Art offers the opportunity to communicate complex issues such as the climate crisis in a way that words alone cannot. It creates images that touch, encounters that inspire and spaces that encourage reflection and action. Thanks to its freedom and diversity, it can reach people on an emotional level and win them over to action against the climate crisis.
We are planning an exhibition on the subject and are inviting artists from all over the world to submit their proposals. We would like to see works that take up this theme and conserve resources in terms of transportation and materials. We will jury them as a team and show them in our rooms.

The climate crisis is the biggest challenge of our time – and yet many people feel powerless to prevent it. How can we address the issue of global warming without overwhelming people? How can we reach people, touch them and motivate them to act?</p><p>Climate communication is key to shaping change. It should motivate people to act, engage them and win over old and new target groups for climate protection. Art offers the opportunity to communicate complex issues such as the climate crisis in a way that words alone cannot. It creates images that touch, encounters that inspire and spaces that encourage reflection and action. Thanks to its freedom and diversity, it can reach people on an emotional level and win them over to action against the climate crisis.</p><p>We are planning an exhibition on the subject and are inviting artists from all over the world to submit their proposals. We would like to see works that take up this theme and conserve resources in terms of transportation and materials. We will jury them as a team and show them in our rooms.</p><p>GG3 Group Global 3000<br> Leuschnerdamm 19, 10999 Berlin</p><p>In a public call for entries, we invite artists to submit contributions for a group exhibition in our exhibition spaces on the theme described above.</p><p>Disciplines: object, sculpture, installation, photography, painting, drawing, printmaking, video with credits given, sound is possible.

CIFRA Launches “Future Recipes” —
An Open Call for Digital Artists Under 30
CIFRA, the international streaming platform for curated digital art, announces Future Recipes, a bold
open call for artists under 30. In an age of global panic, climate crisis, and collective anxiety, CIFRA
invites the next generation of creators to respond with urgency, creativity, and radical sincerity.
This year’s theme — Future Recipes — calls for personal, poetic, and digital blueprints for staying
human in a burning world. Not survival guides, but presence spells. Not solutions, but connections.
“If you’ve got five minutes to show the world who you are — shoot.”
Artists are invited to submit vertical or horizontal format digital works of up to 5 minutes — spanning
video art, animation, AI experiments, 3D, glitch, and more. Any digital medium is welcome, as long as
it speaks truth.
Exhibition at POSITIONS Berlin Art Fair
Selected works will be presented September 11–14, 2025, at POSITIONS Berlin Art Fair, in CIFRA’s digital zone.
15 finalists will be featured on UPcycled digital displays (UPframes) — a fresh, visible format designed to spotlight young digital voices.
Each selected artist will receive:
? Exhibition at POSITIONS Berlin 2025
? €500 artist fee
? International media exposure across CIFRA’s platforms
? Support and mentoring from CIFRA’s curatorial team
Important Dates
? July 1 — Open Call Launch
? August 1 — Submission Deadline
? August 15 — Finalists Announced
? August 22 — Final Files Due
? September 11–14 — POSITIONS Berlin Art Fair
Selection Criteria
CIFRA believes there is no right or wrong when it comes to art. Finalists will be chosen based on
authenticity and emotional truth — personal “recipes” for staying human that resonate with real
experience. The goal is not perfection, but presence.
International Jury
? Nabi Nara – Curator and founder of SOMA Art Berlin; expert in digital culture and public
programming
? Eva Fischer – Artistic Director of CIVA Festival & SOUND:FRAME; lecturer in immersive
media
? Jacek Sosnowski – Curator of the Polish Pavilion at the Venice Architecture Biennale;
Vice-President of Warsaw Gallery Weekend
How to Apply
1. Create a CIFRA account and complete your profile (bio, images, social links)
2. Upload your artwork (video, max 5 minutes)
3. Fill out the submission form –

CIFRA is a platform for next-gen digital expression. From poetic code and 3D dreams to humorous hacks and raw confessions, we believe digital art is the language of the now. We amplify voices that are raw, fragile, powerful — and deeply human.

Punto y Raya Festival 2025
Call for Entries
The ninth edition of Punto y Raya Festival will take place December 3-6, 2025, in Sofia, Bulgaria.
Participation is free and submissions are handled through our website. Simply REGISTER in the portal, create your Artist profile (or use the one you created on a previous occasion), and submit your film within your user account.
https://www.puntoyrayafestival.com
-GENERAL RULES
· Submitted films must be made entirely with ABSTRACT IMAGERY, avoiding representational elements such as cars, people, landscapes, texts, etc. The focus should be on shapes, lines, patterns, blotches, color, and expressive elements in their own right.
· All techniques are welcome: drawing, video composition, CGI, scratch, op-art, stop·motion, camera-less film… the possibilities are endless.
· The soundtrack must not contain any words or lyrics, in any language. You may use instrumental music, silence, noise, abstract sounds, sonic landscapes, vocal textures… anything that does not include intelligible speech.
· Maximum duration: 8 minutes.
· Opening and/or closing credits are welcome.
· Films must have been produced in 2022 or later.
· Please submit your film in FULL HD / 1080p (1920 x 1080 / progressive scan). If a DCP version is available, indicate so in the form – we’ll request it if selected.
· You must provide a direct download link or FTP access to your film. Submissions without downloadable files may be disregarded.
· Preferred formats: .MOV or .MP4, using no or high-quality compression when possible.
ELIGIBILITY
This call is open to everyone, worldwide.
· EVALUATION CRITERIA
· Audiovisual synergy: The interplay between image and sound (or silence), and the depth of exploration in this relationship (40%).
· Plastic expression: Use of form, motion, texture, and color or black & white composition (25%).
· Sound design: Creative use and expressive exploration of sound, texture, and sonority (20%).
· Conceptual approach: Originality and depth of the concept – be it formal, aesthetic, or narrative (15%).
· SELECTION
· You may submit as many works as you wish. However, a maximum of two films per artist may be selected for the official competition.
· Submission does not guarantee selection for screening or inclusion in the PYRTV Platform.
· All entrants will be notified by email regarding the outcome of the selection process. Only selected works will appear on our website and in the PYRTV Catalogue
· Images from the selected works, along with texts provided during the submission process, will be published in our information sheets, website, and PYRTV online Catalogue. Accordingly, entrants are kindly requested to prepare their texts carefully, and to submit stills and avatars in high resolution.
· As part of our mission to build a comprehensive resource hub for abstract film, MAD reserves the right to feature information and images from non-selected works in the PYRTV Catalogue – but never the films themselves. Only links to publicly available versions (e.g. Vimeo, YouTube) will be shared
· Promotional trailers and teasers for press may include brief excerpts from selected films, used exclusively for festival outreach.
AWARDS
· An international jury will present three monetary Prizes, and may also grant one Honorable Mention at their discretion.
The awarded films will also receive a Punto y Raya Statuette, created by a Bulgarian artist.
· This year, we’re thrilled to introduce a monetary Student Prize, awarded by a dedicated Jury. If you’re a student (or made your film during your studies) and it isn’t selected for the Official Competition, remember it will receive a second review for possible inclusion in the Student Competition.To be considered, just make sure to check the student box during the submission process.
· And last but not least, an Audience Award, to be determined by festival attendees, who will vote for their favorite film during the event.
The monetary amounts for the four prizes will be announced once an agreement has been formalized with our sponsors and collaborators.
ENTRY RIGHTS
By participating in this call, the artist conveys the non-exclusive rights to screen their work at Punto y Raya Festival 2025 in Bulgaria.
The curated program “Best of PyR 2025”, featuring the finalist and awarded films, will also be presented at partner animation festivals thoughout the following year. By submitting your film, you agree to its inclusion in these touring screenings if it is selected as a finalist or prize-winner. These events are entirely non-commercial and aim to further share and celebrate this creative achievement. The organization will notify all selected authors ahead of each screening.
In the case of special screenings held in other contexts -such as media exhibitions or multi-day events- where revenue may be generated, the organization will personally reach out to each selected artist to discuss the details and ensure that fair artist fees are arranged.
ACCEPTANCE OF THE RULES

We are looking for submissions of innovative video narratives related to the festival topic Re:MEDIATE, completed in the last three years (2023-2025).

Call for entries
Submissions for the 11th edition of
Bucharest International Dance Film Festival are now open! Filmmakers, dance artists, animators, visual artists and digital art makers are invited to submit their works for the International Short Film Competition of the festival set to take place between September 11–14, 2025, under the theme “Keep Calm and Keep On Moving”. For the first time, BIDFF is also looking for VR experiences that use movement as their main language or the body as their main subject.
The 11th edition of BIDFF, “Keep Calm and Keep on Moving”, aims to create a space for dialogue by bringing to the forefront the affective and emotional crisis in which today’s society finds itself, and by trying to capture the spirit of resilience and reinvention, proving that even in times of uncertainty, movement remains a transformative force. Contemporary dance is created in the present time, with means of the present. It infuses other art forms with new meanings, it has a major potential to transform our relationship with the body and it enriches the way we communicate and express ourselves.
Over the four festival days, dancers, choreographers, visual artists, directors, virtual reality creators, theoreticians and producers are engaged in more than 20 events structured in five sections (Films, VR, Expand, Exchange, Community) characterized by diversity, multiplicity and openness.
Bucharest International Dance Film Festival is a platform for exquisite films that use movement as their primary language or the body as their main subject. Faced with the camera lenses, the body becomes the primary focus of cutting-edge arthouse films that challenge the audience to a lively exchange of stances on challenging politics, extreme emotions, concealed interpretations, and oddly beautiful aesthetics.
BIDFF encourages syncretism and dialogue between movement and diverse forms of cinema, from the more traditional ones to experimental or futuristic hybrid works. Besides film screenings, BIDFF organizes a VR showcase, lectures, public presentations, and intensive short film workshops. Each year in September, the festival takes place in multiple locations from Bucharest, Romania.
HOW TO APPLY
The call opens on May 12. The deadlines for submissions are June 22 (regular) and July 12 (late).
Each director can submit a maximum of two films in the competition.

RULES & TERMS

For the first time, BIDFF is also looking for VR experiences that use movement as their main language or the body as their main subject.

Applications due for 2026 by August 30, 2025. There is one spot open for July – September 2025: application due by June 15, 2025
KUNSTRAUM is calling for submissions for our 2025/26 Artist-in-Residence Program.
KUNSTRAUM is a community of artists by artists with the goal of redefining the collaboration between artists and curators. Through our program, we aim to explore the relationships between artists and curators by opening our gallery spaces to those interested in exploring unconventional, engaging ideas and taking risks.
Our Artist-in-Residency program offers three-month residencies for national and international artists on a quarterly cycle. In 2025, we have one three-month residency open for July-September. For 2026, we currently have open applications for January-March, April-June, July-September, and October-December.
All resident artists are invited to pursue their independent projects, interact with our established community of artists, designers, and filmmakers, interact with the incoming artists and curators of our ongoing exhibition program, participate in the monthly studio visits, and exhibit in the Annual Members’ show in the fall. To learn more about KUNSTRAUM, please visit our Website and Instagram account.
Each Residency Includes:
?	A desk-sized studio in our partitioned lofts with 24/7 access (no living). The semi-private studios inside the large open lofts range from 49 to 89 square feet.
?	Access to our gallery space (4-5 exhibitions a year) and participation in our Annual Members’ Show, including studio visit, professional documentation and programming event
?	Sales opportunities during the show plus via an online gallery for the duration of 6 months after
?	An artist community with 19 members and more than 100 alumni to meet and share with
?	Monthly studio visits by 1-2 New York and international curators, gallerists, critics, and art advisors (see “About” on website for the list)
?	Studio Visit with our Curator-in-Residence and monthly salons with artist community, social media promotion and a feature of your work on our website
?	Access to our internal monthly newsletter, which includes news, events, an open call list with exhibition, grant, and residency opportunities
?	Community events in which all resident and member artists are invited to attend. These community events vary and include gallery openings, curator walkthroughs, discussions, salons, and open studios.
The studio spaces have 24/7 access with 13 ft. ceilings, a freight elevator, slop sink, secure Wi-Fi, and are meant to be used for non-toxic materials only–all painters work on a non-toxic basis. Blick Art Supply, hardware stores, post office, print shops, supermarkets, restaurants, and delis are just 1.5 blocks away, and Home Depot is as close as 10 blocks.
No living is included. The resident artist is responsible for finding their own living and visa arrangements.

KUNSTRAUM is born out of a necessity to create community and foster collaboration between artists, architects, curators, designers, filmmakers, and writers. The KUNSTRAUM model features excellent studio locations, networking, research opportunities, and discourse for creative production. After successfully inaugurating our first space in New York as of February 2015, we seek to expand to Berlin. KUNSTRAUM’s global identity is designed to offer and promote an international community, mobility, and visibility in the visual arts. Recent press coverage includes Communication Arts, Creator’s Project, Huffington Post, Artnet News, Interview Magazine, Art F City, Artnet News, and Musée Magazine. With “Video Shop,” a project at NADA New York, KUNSTRAUM won the 2016 Artfair Goers Award and best booth. To learn more about this, please visit the “About” section at KUNSTRAUMLLC.COM

In 2026, the Contemporary at Blue Star will focus in on a theme of community in its exhibition program in celebration of its 40th anniversary. This theme will be reflected not only in the content of the exhibitions, but also through efforts to foster local, national, and international networks that create lasting connections and opportunities for artists and curators. The Sister City guest Curator Collaborations focus on international cultural exchange and expanding the Contemporary’s reach and network. Curators from the following cities are invited to propose a solo or group exhibition featuring living, contemporary artists from their respective locations.
San Antonio, TX’s Sister Cities include:

The residency supports interdisciplinary and socially engaged practices at the intersection of art, ecology, and research. IPS has appointed LuCAC – Lusaka Contemporary Art Centre, Zambia as the guest jury of experts reviewing the applications.
GASP functions both as an acronym and a metaphor: a gasp for breath and a gasp of astonishment—responding to the suffocation and shocks brought about by ecological crisis and its transformations. It asks:
What lessons about climatic survival may we derive from the territories we participate in?
And with that, HOW MAY THE WORLD BREATHE AGAIN?
Based in Madrid, this residency will serve as a dynamic hub of exchange connecting the selected resident with artists, researchers, and practitioners in Spain, the broader Mediterranean region, and Latin America.
Who Can Apply
All individuals are welcomed whose practice is deeply connected to their local context in the African continent, working in fields including:
Visual arts
Research and education in the arts, culture, or humanities

Archiving and library practices
Community leadership in socially engaged art
Collectives and duos are not eligible to apply.
Applicants may propose new or ongoing multidisciplinary projects that engage with climate-related issues (e.g. heat, drought, eco-territorial concerns) and work meaningfully within specific communities, geographies, or sociopolitical contexts in the African continent.
What the Residency Offers
Accommodation at IPS (private room, bathroom, kitchen, lounge, and shared workspaces)
Studio space shared with IPS team
Curatorial mentorship and one-on-one guidance
Public presentation of the project (format co-designed with IPS)
Access to local networks of artists, curators, and cultural platforms
Visits to institutions and independent spaces in Madrid
Supporting documents for visa application process, including letter of invitation
IPS cannot guarantee the successful processing of a Schengen visa but can recommend how to navigate the process in general terms
Financial Support
3,000 Euros artist honorarium grant – to be paid in two installments – the resident will be asked to generate an invoice documenting each payment

Whether you are looking to organise networking and knowledge sharing activities, festivals, performances, exhibitions, artist residencies, to set up new networks to develop cultural infrastructure, or any other cultural relations project activities, the Spaces of Culture programme could be an exciting opportunity for you and your partners.
Projects are expected to be based on the principles of international cultural relations, practicing mutual listening and learning, engaging in dialogue, co-creation, and joint capacity building.
Your starting point is to develop new or existing collaboration between Sub-Saharan African and European partners, coming together on equal footing to build a project proposal that responds to local challenges and addresses relevant topics with a view to achieve social impact.

The Africa-Europe Partnerships for Culture Programme
The Africa-Europe Partnerships for Culture programme fosters cooperation on an equal footing between African and European artists, creators and cultural professionals and aims to strengthen cultural exchanges at regional level, by supporting cross-border projects and partnerships in all cultural and creative sectors. The programme is structured along the lines of a continental, a Western African, and a Southern African component.
The continental component aims to foster continent-to-continent and people-to-people cultural exchange, co-creation, and co-production. A portion of this component is dedicated to the Spaces of Culture funding scheme, the subject of this call for proposals.
The Spaces of Culture programme brings an exciting opportunity to:
place focus on networking and relationships, new audiences, and opening up civic space;
continue to cultivate and develop a shared cultural relations approach to cooperation between Africa and the European Union (EU);
explore in more depth approaches to fair collaboration in Africa including new and balanced partnerships between Europe and Africa and considerations of ethical sensitivities linked to colonial legacies.
The programme is modelled after the European Spaces of Culture scheme, which since 2019 has been putting the EU’s approach to international cultural relations into concrete 1 EUNIC members are national institutes for culture or other organisations acting for or on behalf of an EU national entity. A list of EUNIC action on the ground in countries outside the EU.
This call, besides being tailored to Sub-Saharan Africa, deepens the work done by European Spaces of Culture by supporting new alliances with local actors that are until now less involved in Africa-Europe cultural relations, as well as a broader implementation of the Team Europe approach, by involving a wider range of EU Member States.
Not only do such initiatives create innovative and meaningful projects, but they also strengthen local and fair partnerships between African and European actors, place on the agenda important societal topics, and lead to invaluable insights into the practice of international cultural relations between Africa and the EU.
Over the period 2025-2028, the programme aims to support around 21 projects, spread out over three calls. This first call, with a
budget of EUR 350,000, aims to support seven projects across the continent.
About this Call
The purpose of this call for proposals therefore is to find and support concrete cultural relations projects taking place in Sub-Saharan African countries. The call will support projects that are designed and implemented by triangular partnerships – based on equal access and ownership – of local cultural and civil society stakeholders from the country(ies) concerned, members of the EUNIC network and EU Delegations2 active on the continent.
Supported projects will demonstrate innovation and relevance to the local context and exemplify both fair partnerships and an elaboration of the Team Europe approach in Sub-Saharan Africa.
The call supports involvement of a broad range of EU Member States, with many EUNIC members having the ambition to start new relationships, open branches, or otherwise intensify their collaboration on the continent, while at the same time broadening the range and diversity of local partner or ganisations from the continent collaboratin with their European counterparts.
This also includes the flexibility to develop and support initiatives in countries on the continent where the presence of Member States is limited or with no existing EUNIC cluster. All EU Member States active on the continent therefore are invited to participate through their network of either cultural institutes or embassies.
What is being looked for?
Projects need to subscribe to the principles of cultural relations and must go beyond the projection and promotion of (the diversity of) European culture in Sub-Saharan Africa. Project activities demonstrate deeper understanding of these principles by practicing mutual listening and learning, engaging in dialogue, co-creation and joint capacity building with all partners involved.
Projects can take any format, focusing on arts, creative industries, digitalisation, education, gender, heritage, human rights, social inclusion, sports, sustainability, tourism, youth, and others.
The call encourages contemporary and innovative formats, including digital or hybrid ones. As preparatory activities for the project, research, feasibility studies, and capacity building initiatives are possible. Projects could also have the potential to be upscaled and translated to a different context.
Whenever possible and relevant, projects will foster free spaces of speech and of artistic expression, particularly in fragile or illiberal contexts. Project ideas stemming from countries notably affected by political, societal, security, or environmental fragility, for instance where freedom of speech or artistic expression is severely restricted, are most welcome, even if the context may feel restrictive to propose a contemporary cultural relations project. The jury will take such sensitivities into consideration on a case-by-case basis.
Projects supported for funding should take place in the period between 1 September 2025 and 31 August 2026 in one or more Sub-Saharan African countries. Applicants are encouraged to explore a cross-border dimension to their proposal.
As the global cultural and civil society sectors are increasingly conscious that culture can – and must – contribute to achieving the UN Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs), this programme creates an opportunity to make this commitment explicit and concrete. All proposals are therefore required to indicate concretely how they contribute to achieving the UN SDGs and identify and justify specific SDGs. Proposals not indicating this will be considered ineligible.
Extra attention should be given to widening access to culture and cultural collaborations, especially amongst:
Youth
People with disabilities
Communities outside urban areas
Communities living in fragile contexts, including environmental and security fragility.
Partnership Requirements
All proposals need to be submitted by a triangular partnership, all actively engaged in the design and implementation of the project. Eligible partnerships:
A minimum of three key local cultural and/or civil society partners. Partners may be public bodies. Specific attention should be given to widen access to the partnership to actors who have been less involved in such intercontinental projects.
A minimum of three Full EUNIC members is required, with a possible exception in countries with limited EUNIC member presence. In such cases it must be made clear why the threshold of three EUNIC members is impossible to achieve. Both EUNIC members’ headquarters and their local branches are eligible. It is not required for EUNIC members to formally be structured as a cluster. When in doubt about whether a potential partner can participate in a project, do not hesitate to contact the EUNIC team.
The EU Delegation(s) in the concerned country(ies) must engage in the project in a concrete and meaningful way, be it in content, public outreach, facilitation of meetings and contacts, or otherwise. For how to get engaged in projects, EU Delegations or partners are welcome to inquire with the EUNIC team.
Partnerships are encouraged to be as inclusive as possible and involve local partners beyond already existing networks. Further-
more, in the spirit of widening access to EU Member States, these partnerships are a suitable opportunity for Member States that
are starting cultural relations activity on the continent.
All partners are required to submit written support letters in the proposal, stating commitment to the project as well as foreseeing their specific role in the project if selected. A template for such letters is provided in the
application package.
Organisations can be involved in multiple applications at the same time. However, it is recommended to focus on one solid and
well-elaborated proposal, rather than spreading too thinly.
To ensure inclusive and shared ownership among the project partners from the start, the project teams are required to form a shared coordination team consisting of one Full EUNIC member, the/an EU Delegation, and one key local partner. This coordination team will together form the first contact points for the EUNIC team concerning the project.
You are invited to have a look at EUNIC’s resources on Fair Collaboration in cultural relations, a set of resources authored by an independent group of experts in cultural relations.
When submitting the application, one of the partners should be designated to sign a grant agreement with EUNIC and receive the
awarded grant if selected. This can be either a EUNIC member or local partner. It is this partner’s responsibility to receive from EUNIC and allocate the funds to other partners in all transparency and according to the pro-
ject budget and activities, and to coordinate the financial reporting back to EUNIC.
Designated partners are required to self-evaluate their experience and capacity to receive such grants, as indicated in the application form. In addition, get in touch with the EUNIC team to make sure the designated partner is a feasible fit.
Financing
Applicants can request up to EUR 50,000 for their project’s implementation. Co-funding from the partners or any third party is required and should be at least 5 % of the requested grant amount (e.g., for a grant request of EUR 50,000, co-funding needs to be at least EUR 2,500).
This co-funding may come from any of the partners or source, except for the EU Delegation, as that would be considered double funding by the EU.
All applicants should submit a budget with their application form, estimating the costs of implementation of the proposed project. A budget template is provided to that end. Once selected, project teams may be asked to revise and detail their budgets for final approval.
Eligible costs are those related to the project and its actions (fees for artists and experts, travel and accommodation, catering, rental of venues or equipment, production of material, etc.), including the hiring of external coordinators/consultants to carry out certain components of the project (studies, mapping of resources, PR/communication, etc.).
Costs not eligible are those related to project communication, the purchase of equipment, overhead costs (organisational costs unrelated to the project), the project partners’ permanent staff costs, as well as costs related to the development of infrastructure. In-kind contributions cannot be included in the overall budget of the project.
Pre-payment of 80% of the awarded grant will be made after an agreement is signed and upon receipt of an invoice before implementation. A final payment (the remaining 20%) will be made upon receipt of a final financial and narrative report. All receipts related to project costs should be kept and made available for a possible audit.
The partner signing the agreement will receive the payments on behalf of the project partners and is responsible for the correct financial administration of the project as well as the final reporting, unless otherwise specifically agreed with EUNIC.
Selection Criteria
All applications will be evaluated along the lines of the same selection criteria below. These reflect – alongside questions such as
on objectives, target groups, and proposed activities – the questions in the application form. The maximum points that can be scored per criterion are included in the application form.
Relevance to local context
The proposal describes the local context, including challenges and opportunities, and the proposal’s relevance to that context. The needs of the local target audiences, civil society, and/or cultural sector to be addressed are clearly identified. The project description is convincing and target groups that are identified fit the objectives that are outlined. In conversation with the EU Delegation, the strategic importance of the project to wider EU priorities is made clear.
Innovation
The proposed project brings new perspectives and processes to Africa-Europe collaboration through culture and goes beyond traditional one-off events:
New concepts or ways of working with local cultural sectors, including digital cultural relations, based on local contexts and needs of local communities;
New ideas on sustainability, accessibility and inclusivity, or entrepreneurship in culture;
New ways of strengthening culture as a vector to promote values such as artistic freedom (of expression), social cohesion, equality, and accessibility and inclusivity.
Partnership set-up
An inclusive approach is at the core of the design and implementation of the project. The proposal includes active inclusion, participation, and governance of all partners: EUNIC members, EU Delegation, local partners, and other stakeholders and ensures ownership by all. The proposal clearly describes the added value and involvement of each part-
ner and actively seeks participation of (local and European) actors new in this field.
Impact foreseen
The proposal states concrete, realistic, and sustainable foreseen results and includes activities and expected results that will last beyond the timeframe of the project that clearly link back to the context and challenges described. Mid- or long-term impact on societies, local cultural scenes, and other target groups are foreseen. The proposal includes concrete mechanisms and indicators to monitor and evaluate the project.
Alignment with UN SDGs
The proposal demonstrates how the objectives, activities, and impact foreseen contribute to the achievement of the SDGs. Individual SDG(s) is/are clearly specified and concretely elaborated on.
Feasibility and cost-effectiveness
The project’s activities are realistic within the timeframe and budget provided and within the local context. Possible risks are considered, and mitigation is foreseen. Activities are appropriately reflected in the budget and proposed costs are reasonable in relation to the activities mentioned and fair remuneration to artists and experts.
Environmental sustainability
The project lays out a strategy for sustainable resources for its activities, addresses and environmental sustainability as a topic and, where relevant, raises awareness of and advocates for climate action.
Selection Process
The EUNIC team will carry out a first eligibility check of incoming applications. An independent jury of experts (both from Sub-Saharan Africa and Europe, but all with thorough knowledge of and experience with Africa-Europe cultural relations), will collectively decide which proposals are to be selected on the basis of the selection criteria.
The independent nature of the jury ensures concentration on quality and relevance to the overall objectives of the programme, but also relevance to local contexts. The Selection Committee will be composed of at least four persons and established based on a set of criteria:
Relevance of knowledge and expertise in the cultural relations between Sub-Saharan Africa and the EU;
Experience in evaluation of grant programmes;
Diversity of professional roles and profiles and lived experience with different regions on the continent.
All applicants will be informed about the decision directly after selection and will receive feedback on their application.
Selected projects will receive feedback from the jury and possible conditions to their selection and will have the time to review and deepen their project plans in a two-month inception phase. Possible elements to look into in more detail are, if needed:
Making more concrete activities and
timelines;
Elaborating on strategies for communication and evaluation;
Adding more detail in the budget;
Making more concrete the approach to actively involve all partners in different facets of implementation (programming, decision making, evaluation, etc.);
elaborating potential future plans beyond the scope of the proposed project.

The eligible implementation period for supported projects is between 1 September 2025 and 31 August 2026.
The EUNIC team must be informed of any major changes in the implementation of the project’s activities, as well as of any changes in the approved budget.
When implementing the project, all partners are obliged to follow all communication requirements as set out in an agreement to be signed with. All partners of selected projects are expected to communicate about the project and its results. Specific communication guidelines will be designed to that end.
The EUNIC team will follow and guide where necessary all teams starting, implementing, and evaluating their projects. All teams are expected to follow a specially designed monitoring and evaluation and reporting methodology, which will help both the project partners and EUNIC in compiling data, information, and results. It is therefore important to keep EUNIC updated about activities taking place within the projects, as well as developments in partnerships.
The EUNIC team will also host regular exchanges with all implementing partners, both collectively in live and online Spaces Labs towards community building and to discuss common themes and developments, and individually to discuss developments and challenges of the projects and partnerships. Implementing partners are expected to participate in such meetings.

Based in the historic city of Diriyah, just outside Riyadh, the programme will welcome its second cohort in October 2025.
Developed in collaboration with France’s Le Fresnoy – Studio National des Arts Contemporains, the programme offers a rare convergence of theory, mentorship, technological immersion and production. Open to artists aged 35 and under with a graduate or postgraduate background in new media or digital art, the call is a beacon for emerging creatives across Saudi Arabia, the wider MENA region, and beyond.
As Saudi Arabia accelerates its investment in culture and innovation, Diriyah Art Futures stands as a cornerstone – preserving the past and prototyping the future. Set against a UNESCO World Heritage Site backdrop, the DAF campus is more than just a home for experimentation; it’s a space for collective reimagining, where art merges with science, and technological practices engage urgent questions around climate, identity, migration, and intelligence.
The inaugural cohort, launched in November 2024, featured twelve artists from eleven countries, all exploring the boundaries of immersive realities, machine learning, spatial sound and post-internet aesthetics. The year will culminate in a curated exhibition showcasing DAF’s vision, scale, and ambition – inviting a new wave of artists to step into the fold.
A curriculum that engages the moment
Structured across one academic year, the programme begins with three months of thematic and conceptual exploration shaped by international artists and theorists. Through lectures, screenings and seminars, participants engage in topics such as climate crisis, post-colonial critique, materiality and the body, artificial systems and intelligence, and regional modernities in contemporary art.
This initial phase is designed to expand how artists think about technology – moving beyond tools and aesthetics to consider new media’s capacity for reflection and reinvention.
Syllabus:
The first three months of the academic year span a series of thematic and conceptual explorations led by artists and theorists through seminars, lectures, screenings, and workshops.
Topics include:
Nature, human, non-human:
In the era of the Anthropocene and in light of the upheavals affecting our environment, the separation that Western society has wreaked with the non-human world is being called into question.
Nature, Climate, Environment and Societal Transformation:
What role does art, particularly digital art, play in all of the current transitions in energy, society, climate and ecology?
The body and technological transformations of living beings:
From the digital body to the cyborg, what are the effects of digital technologies on corporality and bodily representations? How can we develop an understanding of the body and its relationship with self, others or its environment through technology?
Migration, post-colonialism and a critique of capitalism:
A critique of capitalism in crisis through the consequences we are observing today, both from an environmental and migratory point of view.
Mapping Memory, the relationships between digital practices and the archive:
The use or constitution of archives by artists (especially from the Arab World) has intensified thanks to the potential of new digital tools.
Internet and the post-internet era:
Post-Internet Art sometimes takes its inspiration from the Internet Art movement but goes beyond and challenges the notions of network immaterial and material concepts. It questions the increase in connectivity, information overload or so-called concepts of community.
Global Modern and Contemporary Art and Arabic Regionalism:
Reviews on the digital arts related histories of modern and contemporary art, and an additional focus on contemporary art practice from the MENA region and through the lens of the Arab region.
Over the following six months, participants will receive personalised mentorship from prominent artists, and will produce artworks using the technologies offered by the Diriyah Art Futures labs. They will enjoy unique access to innovative technologies such as advanced audio-visual, immersive reality, coding, sensing, machine learning and spatial audio-visual environments. The artwork they produce will be exhibited with Diriyah Art Futures as a final curated and juried outcome of the one-year programme.
Artists are invited to explore a range of contemporary fields in New Media Arts, including:
Reality and Artificial Reality:
An invitation to explore the intersection between the physical and virtual worlds, within a range of technical engagements, from immersive worlds to bio or synthetic material. Questions in this track include how virtual spaces embed themselves in corporality or how virtual spaces engage non-visual sensory experiences? Lastly, the topic explores how artists can subvert this reality using technologies that currently impact human engagement.
Sound and Cinema Creation:
An invitation to examine how artists can push the boundaries of cinema, archive and documentary. A key question is how artists can expand the cinematic and spatial sound experience through digital means, installation, or new cinematic immersive experiences. Additionally, the topic explores how artists envision an expansive and narrative-led digital encounter.
Humans and Artificial Intelligence
An invitation to examine the intersection of humans and machines, with a particular emphasis on the role of artists within this framework. This track focuses on computational creativity, code, machine learning & AI (image, text, speech), robotics, code art, interactivity, and living in data. A key question that arises is what role artists can play in offering a unique perspective on the social and technical events that are reshaping our era and the different perspectives on the issue of new intelligences.
The outcome: a public exhibition
At the programme’s close, artists will exhibit their works at Diriyah Art Futures in a curated showcase. This final exhibition will serve as a culmination and a public-facing invitation to engage with the new ideas, forms and technologies shaped by this rising generation of digital artists.
Who should apply?
Applications are open to artists aged 35 or younger with experience creating new media or digital art. Ideal candidates are recent graduates or postgraduates who demonstrate a strong conceptual practice and a willingness to engage in interdisciplinary thinking. The programme has a global outlook and welcomes international applications, with a strong emphasis on nurturing voices from Saudi Arabia and the wider MENA region.
A space for speculation, collaboration and invention
More than just a residency or training course, the Emerging New Media Artists Programme is a proposition for what art can be in a technologically saturated world. It champions the idea that creativity – when paired with critical inquiry and cutting-edge tools – can offer new aesthetics and new ways of seeing, sensing and shaping the future.
For those ready to move beyond traditional forms and explore the poetic and philosophical potential of emergent creative mediums, Diriyah Art Futures offers the stage, the tools, and the vision.

pIAR IS A HOPE FOR ARTISTIC & CULTURAL ADVENTURE: Participants must be willing and ready to take the challenges and responsibilities in navigating the socio-cultural complexities within Ghana, Kumasi and its environs.
pIAR emerged as a matter of urgency and the need for a safe space for a communal solidarity, radical empathy, learning, unlearning and deconstructing colonial histories and representations. Be mindful that there might be very heavy political and emotional discussions.
pIAR is self-funded with low budget so there are no sophisticated studios and equipments. If you have any special need kindly speak with the team before you apply piarvirtualstudio@gmail.com
pIAR is built on the notions and intersections of activism, radical empathy, performativity, documentation and archiving. NOTE: All participants and activities at pIAR are randomly documented for archival purpose, websites and social media promotions.
Artists have the opportunity to live and collaborate with other artists from a wide range of disciplines, professional experience, ethnicities, cultures and ages.
NO stipend! NO per diem! Applicants are advised to seek external fundings.
Participants must be able to COVER their own travel, visa, health insurance, cost of production and cost of living.
Ghanaian artists living and working in Ghana will be considered for free feeding during their stay.
All international Artists will contribute about 350 EUR per month for food, covering breakfast, lunch and dinner daily during their stay (This is NOT a residency fee, pIAR is a free residency for all).

Curated Isolation will question the impact of contemporary technology and relations that separate us further. We are especially looking for work that conveys vulnerability, understanding, acceptance, and social anxieties in order to cultivate empathy and open conversation. We encourage submissions of any work that presents a moment of time in our increasingly antisocial contemporary society. Examples are artworks depicting a coffee shop with WiFi, a couple dancing with an ignorant crowd passing by, or a restaurant full of people using technology. The works in Curated Isolation will rebuild the conversation of everyday anxiety in a contemporary era. In an evolving society with an unknown future, our communities should have third spaces that build bridges to create open conversation and in turn create empathy. Curated Isolation will reflect how technology continues to separate us. Because of contemporary addictions like cell phones, we are losing the spaces that create communities. Social media furthers us from local gatherings and creates division in public spaces. Artists who make work depicting division or separation of connection and isolation in the 21st Century within social third spaces are of particular interest. Third spaces are ones that are not work or home, allowing a community to intertwine. With a connected community and discussion, empathy can thrive.Location

This includes groups of artists, guilds, and collectives. This call prioritizes collaborative, thematically-driven shows that foster dialogue, experimentation, and community engagement.
The North Gallery is best suited for projects that benefit from a shared curatorial vision, multiple artistic voices, and dynamic use of space. While we appreciate the ambition of solo exhibitions, proposals that feature two or more artists tend to be a better fit for the scale and intent of this gallery. We are not accepting proposals for solo exhibitions at this time.
We’re especially interested in proposals that:
Present a cohesive curatorial or conceptual framework across works by multiple artists
Encourage cross-disciplinary or cross-cultural perspectives
Foster collaboration or dialogue between emerging and established voices
Engage with the social, historical, or material context of Southeast Michigan
We encourage artists to think beyond traditional exhibitions—consider proposals that include participatory elements, site-specific installations, public programming, or community partnerships.
Selection Process
All proposals will be reviewed by the Riverside Arts Center Program Committee. One to two exhibition proposals will be selected and announced in August 2025. Selected exhibitions will be scheduled for Fall 2026. Final dates will be coordinated with selected artists after notification.
The program committee will be looking for professionally finished work with a cohesive theme and unique viewpoint.
*Content Disclaimer* Riverside Arts Center does not wish to censor artists from making their own social and geo-political statements, especially through the means of their creative works. However, RAC maintains an all ages environment and serves a wide and general public. As such, RAC does require artists to work with the staff and board to either make clear disclaimers to the public about the nature of their work in advance of observing it and / or decide together that RAC is the right venue for potentially offensive works.Gallery Information
Riverside Arts Center offers a 3000 sq/ft gallery with eleven panels for 2D art and a multitude of pedestals for 3D objects.Gallery Layout
We use the Walker hanging system. Information can be found at https://walkerdisplay.com/product-category/hooks-holders/
Riverside Arts Center recommends an exhibition with no fewer than 30 works and no more than 60, depending on size. RAC staff will assist in installation and will have final say on exhibited pieces.

PARA explores what it means to be alongside of, to move toward, to stand against or to wander beyond. It speaks to the sense of adjacency and expansiveness inherent to art writing—at once close to a subject while also broadening its scope across intersecting cultural fields. Seeking to interrogate established approaches to art criticism, PARA foregrounds situated practices that attend to diverse forms of criticality.
The programme offers material, communal and institutional support to five fellows, who are selected through an open call. Selected fellows will have an opportunity to publish two pieces of art criticism; engage in biweekly online seminars and tailored feedback sessions with established art writers and critics; attend a fully funded, week-long programme of visits and peer-led gatherings in Sharjah; and develop relationships with fellow writers, editors, publishers and academics, fostering collaborative and transnational networks.
Eligibility: Cultural practitioners, including but not limited to writers, artists, curators, journalists and academics, living and working in Asia or Africa are invited to apply to PARA.
What you get:
A writer’s fee of 2000 AED for their text to be published in the compilation;
A writer’s fee of 3000 AED for their text to be published in the anthology;

Where: Gorizia, Italy
When: January 12 to March 28, 2026, and April 8 to 23, 2026
Deadline for applications: August the 1st 2026
The course is aimed at young artists who have already completed training as dancers, actors, or performers and who wish to move toward theatrical authorship through a structurally transdisciplinary approach, where every expressive form is potentially usable in the creation of a work.
Coordinated by Roberto Castello, the goal of the course is to bring together motivated young talents and offer them the opportunity to study with internationally renowned artists. In addition to workshops focused on movement, expressiveness, rhythm, voice, and singing, the course includes seminars on 20th-century Theatre and Visual Arts, Postcolonial Dynamics, and Elements of Performing Arts Law.
The aim is to form a group of curious, non-conformist, consistent, and rigorous artists—individuals who are aware of their social role and responsibilities, and confident in their opinions and choices.
The course will conclude with a public presentation of the most compelling works created by each participant. The best among these will be invited to the 2026 edition of the Visavì Festival.
How to apply:Fill in the form HERE: https://pnrr.artistiassociatigorizia.it/danza2025/
Costs for participants: The advanced training course will be offered free of charge. Up to 10 students will be selected through a competitive call for applications and granted full exemption from participation fees. The course is free for selected participants.

Where: JK Opole Theatre, Opole, Poland
When: 20–23 September 2025
Deadline for applications: June 27th 2025 (Friday)
Playing with the title of Jacques Rancière’s famous essay The Ignorant Schoolmaster, Greek choreographer and performer Chara Kotsali invites professional dance and movement artists to take part in a four-day intensive choreographic laboratory during the Opole Dance Stage 2025.
Guided by questions such as:
Is there a method to creating choreography
Is the concept more important than the desire to simply create?
Are there rules in the creative process worth breaking?
— we will immerse ourselves in a process rooted in imagination, emotion, embodied knowledge, and the magic of creative action. Challenging the idea of the choreographer as an individual genius and resisting the exoticization of the performing body, we will search for a creative process that is inclusive, sensual, engaged, and poetic.
During the laboratory, we will:
Create a collective piece through movement, writing, conversation, listening, and imagination
Work based on our own experiences, inspirations, and personal movement scores
Explore new strategies in choreography and movement composition together
Conclude the process with an open work-in-progress showing
Laboratory language: EnglishLevel: This open call is intended for professional artists with experience in dance, choreography, performance, theatre, or other forms of physical expression and movement composition.

Durant leur résidence à Metz en 2023-2024, le collectif d’artistes suisse a produit une série de vêtements en collaboration avec des artisanes locales (l’Atelier Les Fusettes et Bröbroderie) et des bénévoles. Graveurs contemporains, les artistes ont imprimé des motifs sur les tissus, inspirés par les collections du musée de la Cour d’Or et de la ville de Metz.
Cette série de vêtements a été présentée lors d’un shooting-performance participatif au musée de la Cour d’Or le 11 mai 2024 dans le cadre du CCS On tour à Metz. Pour ce projet participatif, les artistes ont invité les publics et les agents du Musée à poser pour eux, vêtus des tenues imaginées par le collectif.
De l’ancienne chapelle des Petits-Carmes (l’accueil) aux salles gallo-romaines (Autel de Mithra), le musée a servi d’écrin aux modèles. Les photographies présentées dans cette exposition sont le résultat de ce shooting photo. Mises en scènes et narratives, elles sont inspirées de l’esthétique des magazines de mode et viennent dialoguer avec le Musée.
Découvrez l’exposition des photographies au musée de la Cour d’Or ainsi que les cartes postales éditées pour l’occasion au Frac Lorraine.

Cette initiative éditoriale impulsée par Christophe Catsaros, vise à établir un support de réflexion critique sur la construction en bois, à la croisée de l’architecture, de l’ingénierie et des sciences humaines.
La présentation du 4ᵉ et dernier cahier, paru en juin 2024, sera l’occasion de rappeler les objectifs de cette démarche éditoriale : dépasser la promotion rhétorique du bois et les recours cosmétiques, pour tendre vers une gestion holistique de la ressource, de l’arbre jusqu’à l’élément de construction.
Cette rencontre permettra également d’échanger avec Yves Weinand, directeur de l’Ibois sur les projets de recherche les plus récents menés au sein du laboratoire.
La conférence suivie d’un moment convivial autour d’un apéritif, se tiendra à Même si, un nouvel espace culturel de débats et d’expositions inauguré en 2025 qui place le développement durable au cœur de sa mission.
© Les cahiers de l’Ibois. Graphisme Notter + VigneCahier de l'Ibois 4Le bois est-il nécessairement synonyme de durabilité? L’existence d’un néologisme spécifique pour l’écoblanchiment à base de bois suffit à réfuter cette affirmation. Les magazines d’architecture regorgent d’exemples de woodwashing, allant de la promotion rhétorique du bois aux recours cosmétiques et aux usages non durables basés sur une exploitation irresponsable des ressources.
Le débat organisé à l’EPFL en décembre 2022 dans le cadre des Superonda Talks a ouvert la voie à un examen critique des critères qui font du bois un matériau durable. Réutilisabilité, modularité et gestion holistique du cycle de la production à la construction sont autant de paramètres essentiels à prendre en compte pour qualifier une approche constructive de durable. L’échange entre Sarah Nichols, Yves Weinand, Stéphane Berthier et Mario Rinke a également permis de rappeler à quel point le bois, comme le béton au 20e siècle, est aujourd’hui pris dans un carcan économique, médiatique et culturel étroit qui conditionne notre perception.
Ce 4e numéro clôt un premier cycle éditorial visant à établir, au sein d’Ibois, un organe de réflexion critique sur la construction en bois au croisement de l’architecture, de l’ingénierie et des sciences humaines.éléments biographiquesChristophe Catsaros
Christophe Catsaros est critique d’architecture. Rédacteur en chef de la revue suisse Tracés de 2011 à 2018, il a également dirigé les éditions du centre d’architecture arc en rêve à Bordeaux entre 2022 et 2025. Son parcours l’a conduit à occuper des fonctions variées : assistant curateur au Witte de With de Rotterdam, enseignant à l’ESAC de Cambrai, ou encore co-éditeur des 4 Cahiers de l’IBOIS, une revue d’analyse critique dédiée à la construction bois.
En 2013, il initie L’Architecture à l’écran, un cycle de projections à la Cinémathèque suisse explorant les liens entre architecture et cinéma. Le projet évolue en Écrans Urbains lorsqu’il est repris par arc en rêve en 2018. Il collabore régulièrement avec des médias spécialisés (artpress, archistorm, L’Architecture d’Aujourd’hui, Le nouveau Genève) et est l’auteur de plusieurs ouvrages chez Actes Sud, consacrés à l’œuvre de Patrick Bouchain.
Yves Weinand
Yves Weinand est professeur de construction bois à l’École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) en Suisse, où il dirige le Laboratoire de construction bois, IBOIS. En tant que laboratoire transdisciplinaire de la faculté ENAC, IBOIS est actif à la fois au sein de l’Institut d’architecture (IA) et de l’Institut de génie civil et environnemental (IIC). Yves Weinand a obtenu un master en architecture à l’Université de Liège en 1986, un master en génie civil à l’EPFL en 1994, puis un doctorat en génie mécanique à l’Université technique RWTH d’Aix-la-Chapelle en 1998.

L’existence d’un néologisme spécifique pour l’écoblanchiment à base de bois suffit à réfuter cette affirmation.

Réutilisabilité, modularité et gestion holistique du cycle de la production à la construction sont autant de paramètres essentiels à prendre en compte pour qualifier une approche constructive de durable. L’échange entre Sarah Nichols, Yves Weinand, Stéphane Berthier et Mario Rinke a également permis de rappeler à quel point le bois, comme le béton au 20e siècle, est aujourd’hui pris dans un carcan économique, médiatique et culturel étroit qui conditionne notre perception.<br><br> Ce 4e numéro clôt un premier cycle éditorial visant à établir, au sein d’Ibois, un organe de réflexion critique sur la construction en bois au croisement de l’architecture, de l’ingénierie et des sciences humaines.</p></div><details class=detail><summary>éléments biographiques</summary><p>Christophe Catsaros<br> Christophe Catsaros est critique d’architecture.

Depuis 2003, Les Trois Points de suspension parcourent les villes, les campagnes, les salles de spectacles, les aires d’autoroutes, les zones industrielles, les forêts pour raconter des histoires.
Ils et elles explorent des lieux pour inventer du théâtre, des performances, des expositions et autres formes partageables pour offrir un toit à nos doutes, nos certitudes, nos mélancolies, nos joies et nos angoisses. Une mise en récit du monde pour remplir l’avenir de possibles et de récits viables. Raconter pour lutter efficacement contre la réalité, les définitions, les conventions, les facilités, les habitudes, l’inertie, la crainte, la contrainte, le confort, l’interdiction… tous ces trucs qui nous empêchent un peu dans nos têtes.
Inventer des histoires pour qu’elles se prolongent dans nos vies, pour trouver des prétextes à nous enlacer, pour anticiper le jour où l’on sera enfin heureux, pour profiter pleinement de la grande aventure d’être nous autrement.
En 2016, pour transformer leur manière de faire et de concevoir l’art, un groupe dissident des 3 Points de suspension décide de monter une organisation parallèle en terre Helvète. Naît alors le collectif 3615 Dakota, une sorte d’agence tout risque du réel et pluridisciplinaire issu du cirque, de la musique, du théâtre, de la danse, des arts plastiques et des sciences sociales qui travaille à changer le monde dans l’ombre de la réalité.
En 2023, 3 Points de suspension & 3615 Dakota décident d’affirmer pleinement leur singulière identité : celle de Transfrontalier. L’art n’a pas de frontières disciplinaires et territoriales ; il est temps de l’assumer tant dans ses productions que dans sa diffusion.Partenaire","","<div class=content_center><div class=content_summary><p>Quatre adultes se retrouvent propulsé·es sur les rives de leur jeunesse et retraversent les jeux de l’enfance dans toute la splendeur de leur joie et de leur férocité.
