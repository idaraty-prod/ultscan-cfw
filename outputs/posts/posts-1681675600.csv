This will develop two research and production projects within the local contexts of Huarte and Barcelona, based upon the concept of the hybrid residency and aiming to work with the specific nature of these local contexts using social space activation processes. The hybrid residency will combine an on-site temporary presence along with previous and subsequent work to be carried out remotely. The two projects will be selected through a joint open call for submissions, and will be carried out between September and December 2023.
Transversal Aesthetics is a programme for research and experimentation on the intersection between art, mediation and social space. This latest edition makes a connection between the local context of the Arga river (Huarte) and that of the river Besòs (Barcelona), examining the common theme of ‘Air’. Taking this as a starting point, the organisers seek projects that specifically address the complexity of dealing with air in contemporary thought.
The work carried out as part of Transversal Aesthetics will follow three common strands: organising a temporary artistic residence, with the participation of an artist or a collective as creator and researcher within the context; setting up a local node involving various regional agents and associations; and organising a transfer of knowledge and learning related to other fields and subjects (Mediation Activities). These three strands may cross over, they may work in unison, or they may coexist in parallel, so that at least two of them will work together on the same project.
The call is aimed at artists interested in developing an artistic project within the social contexts in which the proposal is set, and on the specific theme proposed. Proficiency in Spanish and / or Basque will be valued positively. In the event that English should be the main language used in the project, translation should be considered as part of the production, in those activities that may require translation.
The selected proposal will be granted 2300 euros in fees and expenses, and up to 750 euros for help with travel and accommodation. A maximum of 1400 euros will be available for production. In the event that accommodation is not necessary, part of the travel costs may be used for production, or conversely, where greater face-to-face involvement in the context is required and production is less or can be covered by other funding, the both fees may be used interchangeably.","","","<div id=block-otm-content class=""block block-system block-system-main-block""><article role=article about=/news/idensitat-centro-huarte-hybrid-researchproduction-residencies-transversal-aesthetics-air-spain class=""node node--type-news-calls node--promoted node--view-mode-full""><div class=node__content><div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item""><p><span class=caps>IDENSITAT</span> and Centro Huarte are initiating the Transversal Aesthetics / In the Air programme.

This open call is for an ECHO Academy focused on comics that will take place in Athens, Greece from 12 June – 2 July 2023.
10 Selected comic artists will travel and stay in Athens for a period of 3 weeks and create:
An artwork inspired by Karagiozis Shadow Puppet Theater.
A plan for a pilot project designed to be implemented in their home country in collaboration with partner organisation Inter Alia and a local micro-organisation.
The call is addressed to artists that live in (a) EU countries and (b) countries of the Western Balkans (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia). Basic knowledge of the English language is required.
The final selection of the ten (10) participating artists will consist of 5 artists from the EU and 5 artists from the Western Balkans.
The selected artists will create original comic artworks (2-5 pages per comic artist) that will be published in a collective volume by Jemma Press. Comic artists will need to transfer the economic rights (granted by copyright) of the final designs to Inter Alia for the purposes of the publication. The artists will retain the moral rights of their works, along with the copyrights of any sketches they will create during their participation in the Academy. Revenue generated by the selling of the publication will be attributed directly to the artists at regular intervals.
At the end of the Academy, an international judging committee will elect three winners (based on both their artistic creations and the pitching of their pilot projects) that will receive a cash prize, and will be called to implement the presented pilot project in their home countries using ECHOAc funding.
The prizes for the winning artists are:
1st prize: €3000
2nd prize: €2000
3rd prize: €1000
The three associated micro-organisations (selected by the winners) will also receive €2000 each for the needs of the project implementation.
The programme covers travel costs and accommodation expenses, and foresees food for the whole duration of the Academy.","","","<div id=block-otm-content class=""block block-system block-system-main-block""><article role=article about=/news/echo-academies-call-comic-artists-greece class=""node node--type-news-calls node--promoted node--view-mode-full""><div class=node__content><div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item""><p><span class=caps>ECHO</span> Academies (<span class=caps>ECHOA</span>c) is an arts project that aims to foster young and emerging European talents in the fields of comics, fashion design, music, photography and architecture by connecting them to heritage as a means and inspiration for their work.</p><p>This open call is for an <span class=caps>ECHO</span> Academy focused on comics that will take place in Athens, Greece from 12 June – 2 July 2023. </p><p>10 Selected comic artists will travel and stay in Athens for a period of 3 weeks and create: </p><ul><li>An artwork inspired by Karagiozis Shadow Puppet Theater.</li><li>A plan for a pilot project designed to be implemented in their home country in collaboration with partner organisation Inter Alia and a local micro-organisation.</li></ul><p>The call is addressed to artists that live in (a) <span class=caps>EU</span> countries and (b) countries of the Western Balkans (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia).

They invite emerging and established researchers worldwide to apply, including students, faculty, and independent scholars.
The Writer in Residence programme offers a first look at newly processed primary sources and provides the opportunity to conduct research on exceptional artists and movements from postwar and contemporary Latin American art.
This summer, selected Writers in Residence will work remotely to explore materials from one of three fully digitised collections from the ISLAA Library and Archives: the Manuel Herreros de Lemos and Mateo Manaure Arilla Collection, a collection of selected artist’s books by Anna Bella Geiger, and the ‘El Dibujazo’ Collection. Residents will produce an essay based on their selected digital collection, in alignment with their own research interests and expertise. Each selected participant will be awarded a $2000 grant in recognition of these research and writing endeavours.","","","<div id=block-otm-content class=""block block-system block-system-main-block""><article role=article about=/news/institute-studies-latin-american-art-writer-residence-remote class=""node node--type-news-calls node--promoted node--view-mode-full""><div class=node__content><div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item""><p><span class=caps>ISLAA</span> is delighted to announce the call for proposals for its Summer 2023 Writer in Residence programme.

LAPA makes its connection with communities and asks what kind of potential could we encourage when we are housed together. Enacting the term LAPA, the residency becomes a space of communing to explore themes of home, family and place.
In 2023 the open call extends within Africa to expand on the continental network and establish necessary travel and connection.
The residency ideates on borderless states of being as a way to consider new pan-africanism and African states. This is beyond language but underpinned by modes of speaking through the visual, sonic, digital and more.
Taken from a text by Amilcar Cabral who prefaced ideas of unity and struggle within the African agenda, the phrase ‘Our people are our mountains’ illustrates the landscape and its metaphors as a condition of life: what is tied and coded between people into land and how it writes many other conditions of living.
Artists apply to one of three separate residency sessions:
Session 1 - Enunciation: Voicing in many forms: 1 September – 25 November 2023.
Session 2 – Imbibe earthen processes: 5 February – 27 April 2024.
Session 3 – Contextual landings: 2 September – 23 November 2024.
LAPA is developed for artists across all disciplines, based in Africa, who have been professionally active for at least 6 years. Priority will be given to pairings working on the continent or between the continent and the diaspora, understanding that these links exist in dynamic and political ways. The duo/pair/collective will seek to expand their working relationship to continue developing their artistic language and research. The residency can accommodate up to two representatives from an artist collective.
The organisers cover travel to and from LAPA (return flight and ground travel from OR Tambo Intl. Airport to Brixton, Johannesburg) and monthly living/subsistence costs. There is also a fee of 6000 ZAR/month (each) to cover basic living expenses and materials and resources. A separate budget allocation is made for the artist’s production budget and a public moment.","","","<div id=block-otm-content class=""block block-system block-system-main-block""><article role=article about=/news/lapa-residency-duoscollectives-our-people-are-our-mountains-south-africa class=""node node--type-news-calls node--promoted node--view-mode-full""><div class=node__content><div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item""><p>Housed in the Breezeblock building in the suburb of Brixton, Johannesburg, <span class=caps>LAPA</span> is a place to gather, for collaboration, experimentation and developing new trajectories in artistic practice. <span class=caps>LAPA</span> makes its connection with communities and asks what kind of potential could we encourage when we are housed together.

This international get-together welcomes practitioners, organisations and institutions, policymakers, thinkers, researchers, activists and artivists from the cultural, social and health sectors working on topics related to care, well-being, health and culture. Handle with Care | Culture for Social Well-being will take place in Elefsina, Greece from 7-10 June 2023. It is co-organised by Culture Action Europe, 2023 Eleusis European Capital of Culture, the CultureForHealth project, and is co-financed by the European Union.
The multitude of crises our societies are facing today, including the climate and social injustice, wars, pandemic, economic and political upheavals in and beyond Europe, requires an urgent cultural response: a response rooted in care for the planet and communities, care for each other. To navigate these uncertainties, we are in search of a compass, a sense of direction towards a sustainable, democratic, caring future. The Handle with Care | Culture for Social Well-being gathering aims to collectively explore the significance of care as an ethical and political obligation for our societies and the role culture and cultural professionals can play in this. It will specifically discuss the evidence on the role of culture in improving health and well-being. How can culture and participation in the cultural life of communities nourish a sense of social and individual well-being?
The 2023 edition of the Beyond the Obvious gathering will also feature the Handle with Care Agora. It is an informal marketplace showcasing local and international/European projects working with the topics of care, community and individual well-being, health, mental health and culture. The aim of the Agora is to bring different perspectives from arts, heritage, human rights, health, research, politics, activism etc. and mix initiatives from Greece with similar projects coming from all over Europe and beyond to create an open space for networking and peer learning.
30 selected projects will present their initiatives during the gathering, will have free access to the conference and will be awarded a bursary of 300 euros to support their participation in the Handle with Care | Culture for Social Well-being gathering.","","","<div id=block-otm-content class=""block block-system block-system-main-block""><article role=article about=/news/culture-action-europe-call-projects-present-handle-care-agora-greece class=""node node--type-news-calls node--promoted node--view-mode-full""><div class=node__content><div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item""><p>‘Handle with Care | Culture for Social Well-being’ is the 2023 edition of Culture Action Europe’s Beyond the Obvious gathering.

Three selected participants will receive direct insight into the workings of Performa’s artist-centric commissioning programme and work directly with the Performa team in New York, learning Performa’s methods for presenting, and preserving performance by visual artists in the lead up to the Performa Biennial that will take place from 1-19 November 2023.
Candidates must seek experience in curating and producing performance, beyond what curatorial degrees can offer. They must hold a minimum of a Bachelor’s Degree in art history, curatorial, museum or performance studies, arts administration or relevant work experience. Special interest in performance, architecture, and new media is strongly recommended.

In cooperation with the Department for Culture, World Heritage and Sport of the City of Augsburg, Cities Ahead is launching an open call to creatives worldwide. They are looking for placemaking projects for the creative (temporary) transformation of public space in Augsburg, in the overarching context of sustainable cultural urban development. The focus should be on the needs, aspirations, wishes and visions of the local population.
The placemaking projects are intended to strengthen the connections between people and places and relate to one of the following two locations in Augsburg:
Maximilianstraße: Maximilianstraße in the old town of Augsburg is one of the most important streets in Germany in terms of art history, with buildings from the Renaissance, Rococo, Neo-Classical and post-war Modern periods. As a pilot project, part of Maximilianstraße will be traffic-calmed for one year starting in May 2023, providing space for project ideas.
The Augsburg Theatre District: This new theatre district is currently being created as a sustainable urban quarter in a participatory process. In the process, new public spaces are also being created, the opening of which is to be additionally promoted through various placemaking projects.
The aim of submitted projects should be to improve the quality of stay at the selected location and to promote aspects of ecological, economic, social and/or cultural sustainability. Furthermore, projects should have a participatory approach and thus lead to a greater sense of responsibility and belonging among the citizens of the city. Projects are to be implemented in the second half of 2023 (by November at the latest).
The programme will fund a total of two projects by creatives from all over the world with experience working in public spaces and a participatory approach, i.e. they involve citizens and/or the municipality in their work. Selected projects will receive a grant of €4000 each for the further conception and implementation of the placemaking project on site. The grant includes a lump sum for travel expenses and any additional material or development costs.","","","<div id=block-otm-content class=""block block-system block-system-main-block""><article role=article about=/news/goethe-institut-cities-ahead-augsburg-germany class=""node node--type-news-calls node--promoted node--view-mode-full""><div class=node__content><div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item""><p>Cities Ahead is a European programme initiated by the Goethe-Institut that supports municipalities in cultural urban development that want to make the best possible use of the existing potential of the cultural and creative industries and strive for international visibility.</p><p>In cooperation with the Department for Culture, World Heritage and Sport of the City of Augsburg, Cities Ahead is launching an open call to creatives worldwide.

In this call, the focus is on artists who share the values of Basca Theater and the ‘in : v z b l festival’: solidarity, dialogue, respect and dignity. Artists are expected to respect these values and take them into account in creating and conducting community interventions.</p><p>in : v z b l festival was born from the need to bring together artists from several fields, who could interact with various categories of audiences. This meeting aims to offer everyone (artists and the public) different perspectives on the reality around us. The desire is to initiate a dialogue through which what is sometimes ‘invisible’ in society begins to become visible, through art. </p><p>The voices of various vulnerable, ‘invisible’ groups are often unheard or even unspoken. Through this festival Basca Theater want to give these groups a voice and context to self-represent and to make this voice stronger in the community. Diversity is an underexploited wealth.

PLANT is a collaboration between three research and creation centres: CRL – Central Elétrica in Porto (PT) – project coordinator, Isadora & Raymond Duncan Dance Research Center in Vyronas, Athens (EL) and Espai nyamnyam in Mieres, Girona (ES).
Through a mutual exchange of experiences, local concerns, methodologies and tools, the project will conceive and develop new sustainable artistic methodologies based on Raymond Duncan’s heritage, the Permaculture principles and Contextual Art Practices while advocating the notion of ‘commons’ in art as a key concept in addressing urgent social and environmental challenges.
PLANT is now calling for proposals for artistic projects to be developed through residencies of 1 year period, in the countries involved in the project (Portugal, Greece and Spain). They are looking for three artists or collectives (represented by a maximum of 2 people), who have carried out previous works focused on relational modes, and are committed to participating in the development of artistic practices and methodologies capable of establishing strong connections with diverse places and contexts.
From October 2023 to October 2024, the selected artists or collectives will participate in internal meetings, artistic residencies and open moments in Portugal, Spain, Greece and online. They will develop artistic methodologies and implement them in each context and then meet in Portugal for the final replication of the created works. The three partner centres will actively participate in accompanying each process to relate to context.
The funding allocated for each selected project is 7000 euros (all taxes included). Adding to that, the project will cover travel, accommodation, food expenses and also a limited amount for project implementation. The selected projects should cope with the project framework to produce sustainable practices aligned with the permaculture principles.","","","<div id=block-otm-content class=""block block-system block-system-main-block""><article role=article about=/news/open-call-plant-performing-life-akademia-network-portugal-greece-spain class=""node node--type-news-calls node--promoted node--view-mode-full""><div class=node__content><div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item""><p>Performing Life Akademia Network [<span class=caps>PLANT</span>] is a 2-year transdisciplinary project, funded by Creative Europe Programme, that aims to encourage the development and experimentation of contextual artistic and curatorial practices around cross-performing arts, eco-thinking and everyday life. <span class=caps>PLANT</span> is a collaboration between three research and creation centres: <span class=caps>CRL</span> – Central Elétrica in Porto (<span class=caps>PT</span>) – project coordinator, Isadora <span class=amp>&amp;</span> Raymond Duncan Dance Research Center in Vyronas, Athens (<span class=caps>EL</span>) and Espai nyamnyam in Mieres, Girona (<span class=caps>ES</span>).</p><p>Through a mutual exchange of experiences, local concerns, methodologies and tools, the project will conceive and develop new sustainable artistic methodologies based on Raymond Duncan’s heritage, the Permaculture principles and Contextual Art Practices while advocating the notion of ‘commons’ in art as a key concept in addressing urgent social and environmental challenges.</p><p><span class=caps>PLANT</span> is now calling for proposals for artistic projects to be developed through residencies of 1 year period, in the countries involved in the project (Portugal, Greece and Spain).

Established in 2012, Collide is the international residency award that brings arts and science together in collaboration with leading cultural institutions in Europe.
Collide Copenhagen residency award is the new collaboration framework between CERN and CC that aims to support artistic research on art, science, and technology. Within this unique collaboration framework, Collide will be taking place annually over a three-year period (2023-2025).
For the first edition and the following annual calls, Arts at CERN and CC are inviting artists to reflect on the impact of science and research in contemporary culture. Proposals that consider the role of advanced technologies and novel scientific models as major topics in society are welcome. Collide is especially seeking artistic proposals that reflect on themes such as artificial intelligence, the modelling and analysis of vast datasets, the emergence of quantum technologies, and their interpretation from philosophical and ethical standpoints.
The artists selected for the 2023-2025 editions will be invited to take part in an ambitious exhibition at CC in 2025, investigating technology’s impact on humanity.
Artists from any country in the world are invited to submit an application proposing a project that combines research and production of a new work to develop during a two-month residency. The residency will be split in two periods, the first month at CERN (October 2023) and the second month in Copenhagen (November 2023). The scope of this proposal will include a research period in both locations, and a posterior development phase to define and produce a new artwork, with the curatorial support of both curatorial teams in Geneva and Copenhagen.
Collide offers the selected artist or artist collective the following financial support and conditions:
Living expenses for two months at CERN, Geneva, and Copenhagen.
Travel costs and accommodation within a fixed budget for the artistic residency period at CERN and Copenhagen.
A production stipend of CHF 15,000.
In case of an artist collective, all these costs will be split between the members. A maximum of 2 members of a collective can be hosted at the same time as residents.","","","<div id=block-otm-content class=""block block-system block-system-main-block""><article role=article about=/news/cern-copenhagen-contemporary-collide-copenhagen-2023-switzerland-denmark class=""node node--type-news-calls node--promoted node--view-mode-full""><div class=node__content><div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item""><p><span class=caps>CERN</span>, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics in Geneva, and Copenhagen Contemporary (<span class=caps>CC</span>) are proud to collaborate in the framework of the Collide residency award.

Currently, eight Vienna-based artists work in studio das weisse haus’ space located at Hegelgasse 14. While some use photography to document their performances or drawing processes, others employ it as a field for experimentation, such as cyanotype. Some of the artists portray people or record urban changes. However, all of the artists share photos of their works and installation views on their website and social media. Photography is omnipresent in the daily life of an artist, it is impossible to get around without it. Following this year’s theme of the festival (Photography Lies), this residency programme would like to question where the truth ends and the lie of photography begins.
The residency includes:
A grant of 800 euros.
A travel voucher of up to 200 euros for travelling green within a radius of 1000 kilometres.
A living voucher of 500 euros.
A working space free of charge.
The organisation of a presentation as well as two open studios with the studio artists during the festival FOTO WIEN. Therefore, a production budget of up to 500 euros is available.

SPECTRAL is a Creative Europe project developed by European laboratories that promote expanded cinematic art. Crater-Lab’s programme in this project explores the screen as an active protagonist: receiving screen, expanded and contracted, in motion, light or dark, canvas screen, mirror screen, without screen, without projection…
The SCREEN residency offers three grants of four weeks of residence each, to carry out a project or part of a project of expanded cinema, paracinema, installation or film sculpture, that explores the concept of SCREEN.
These residencies are intended for artists whose work is focused on cinematic art practices such as live performance, installation, sculptures mainly worked with film / photochemical and/or in dialogue with other formats or disciplines particularly interested in the Screen and the Object of screening as a main subject. Proposals that suggest dialogues and relations with new media and other technologies are especially welcome.
Residencies will take place at Hangar / Crater-Lab in Barcelona, Spain in one of three slots:
1-30 July 2023.
1-30 September 2023.
27 October – 27 November 2023.

Whether it’s innovative tech solutions or ways of meeting, proposed projects should involve older people and thus create a platform that shows appreciation for their activities, opinions and the issues they face.

0–6 years old: Infants and children of nursery age and their families.

11–18 years old: Children and young people of school age.
19–27 years old: Young adults.
60+ years old: Older people.

The call intends to network the creative artists and the cultural and artistic institutions in this three-country region in order to define the new social challenges from different perspectives. The idea is for interested parties to have an opportunity to get to know each other, thereby laying the foundations for potential, sustainable, regional and international cooperation.
An aspect of particular interest is discovering ways in which the cultural differences in living conditions where the three countries meet represent a source of wealth for Europe as well as underscoring common ground as a connecting element. The intention is to exchange ideas on all levels, from everyday culture to high culture. Peace and remembrance work are to play a prominent role in this. Activities around the Capital of Culture year 2025 aim to sustainably strengthen relations between the people of this region and foster visible cross-border cooperation.
Kulturhauptstadt Europas Chemnitz 2025 GmbH will provide support to bilateral or trilateral cooperation projects as part of a two-stage process.
Stage 1 is an ideas competition with a submission period from 27 February to 31 August 2023. If selected by the advisory board, the project idea is worked out in stage 2 and developed into a project plan. Projects in this stage will be financed for a maximum of 5000 EUR.
Stage 2 consists of a project development process starting on 1 May 2024, based on the project plans developed in the first stage and updated in the second stage, with the aim of implementation in the Capital of Culture year 2025.

The Adjunct Curator will provide expertise from their country of residence and carry out research for Tate.
Hyundai Tate Research Centre: Transnational promotes new ways of interpreting and presenting art through the framework of ‘transnational’; a way of understanding and curating art that encourages the idea that art and its histories are interconnected beyond its country of origin. Embedded within Tate’s curatorial vision, the Centre’s work is involved in exhibitions, acquisition strategies, collection displays, public programme and digital outputs.
Hyundai Tate Research Centre: Transnational’s key research strands are committed to developing and furthering conversations around decoloniality, indigeneity, migration and diaspora, and ecology. The Adjunct Curator will have a keen understanding of how ecology relates to histories of colonialism and extractive capitalism, as well as a demonstrable commitment to climate and social justice. The position will require the Adjunct Curator to work closely with Tate’s existing collection to further develop narratives around ecological issues and create links across the collection. The postholder will also work in support of the overall programme at Tate Modern and other Tate sites, helping to articulate discussions around environmental justice. The Adjunct Curator will be expected to convene a public facing programme during their time at Tate. They will also contribute to Tate’s institutional commitment to climate justice by forming part of relevant Working Groups and Staff Networks.
This post will be held by a researcher or curator with experience and engagement with communities, organisations and/or institutions working at the intersection of art and ecology. This will be demonstrated by a sustained engagement, evidenced in their writings, curatorial projects, and/or equivalent experience. A transnational outlook is important, since a specific focus should be considered in a broader historic and intellectual remit, as well as in the context of transnational activism and critical debates.

The scheme is composed of two action lines:
Individual mobility for artists and cultural professionals.
Residencies for host organisations.
This call is addressed to residency hosts that are legal entities based in one of the 40 Creative Europe countries. The purpose of the grant is to welcome international artists and cultural professionals at your premises to implement a residency project. The participating artists and cultural professionals must be legal residents in a Creative Europe country that is different from the host’s country.
Residency hosts should be active in one or more of the following sectors:
Architecture.
Cultural heritage.
Design and fashion design.
Literary translation.
Music.
Performing arts.
Visual arts.
What is the residency action for?
You can apply for funding for a residency project with a proposal that includes its objectives, expected impact and duration. You will act as a mentor to artists and cultural professionals, and should provide them with the environment, support and equipment adapted to their field of expertise, so that they can focus on their individual or collective projects.
The residency project should pursue one or two of the following objectives:
To explore: To conduct research, to investigate and work on a specific theme or a new concept.
To create: To engage in a collective creative process seeking to produce a new piece of artistic/cultural work.
To learn: To enhance the participants’ competences through non-formal learning or collaboration with a specialist.
To connect: To develop a network, to strengthen the participants’ professional development.
To transform: To enable societal change in line with the New European Bauhaus values and principles.
You can welcome between 1 and 5 international artists and cultural professionals who must all participate in the residency project on the same dates and for the same duration. The residency can last between 22 and 300 days.
When applying, you must choose one of the following durations:
Short-term residency project: between 22 and 60 days.
Medium-term residency project: between 61 and 120 days.
Long-term residency project: between 121 and 300 days.
Support
The residency grant contributes to the costs connected to hosting international artists and cultural professionals and their mobility. This includes housing costs (fixed €35 per day), a mobility grant covering a travel allowance (€350 for distances between 601-5000km, €700 for 5001km+) and daily allowance (€25 per day), and various top-up allowances that support green travel and the participation of Overseas Countries and Territories or Outermost Regions, disabled artists and professionals, persons with children below the age of 10, and those with visa expenses.
Timeline
Selected residency projects must be carried out and completed within 1 year from the signature of the grant agreement.
Culture Moves Europe’s residency action will offer 4 open calls between spring 2023 and autumn 2024. The first call is open from 15 March until 15 June 2023 23.59 (Central European Summer Time).

In its second cycle, the Contemporary Performing Arts Research Residency is an artistic research development programme by Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay, supported by the National Arts Council, Singapore.
The fully funded residency aims to support creative research in contemporary performing arts by providing its residents the time and space for artistic inquiry, experimentation, development, research activities and opportunities for interdisciplinary and transcultural dialogues. The residency welcomes various manners and methodologies of enquiry, embracing a pluralistic approach towards research that unfolds not only through the written word, but also includes forms of experimentation with the body, performed moments, and other non-traditional systems of knowledge.
There is no commitment for residents to create a production during or after the residency. Instead, residents will be asked to present at least one public programme of their choosing, developed in conversation with the Esplanade Team.
The residency is a duration of between one month to three months long and residents will receive a stipend (S$2,000 per month), an allowance of up to S$1,000 for research materials or support (subject to approval), access to a shared-working space, studios when required, as well as accommodation and international travel to or from Singapore, if from abroad.
In 2024, the residency presents the thematic focus Decentring Access, which aims to engage the term’s multiple definitions and usages in all contexts and facilitate nuance in access-related discussions. Engaging with the dynamics of inclusion and exclusion, the residency seeks to support research projects that employ performativity as a lens to examine pertinent issues today. These topics are not limited to equity, inclusivity in physical and digital worlds, movement, ownership, climate crisis, power relations, age, gender, race, disability, language and knowledge circulation.","","","<div id=block-otm-content class=""block block-system block-system-main-block""><article role=article about=/news/esplanade-contemporary-performing-arts-research-residency-singapore class=""node node--type-news-calls node--promoted node--view-mode-full""><div class=node__content><div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item""><p>Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay invites artists, curators, programmers, writers, researchers and practitioners across all disciplines in the performing arts to apply for the Contemporary Performing Arts Research Residency, taking place in Singapore between April and June 2024.

The Program objective is to identify new, powerful architectural languages for a sustainable built environment and to support this transformation via architectural quality and design expression. The Program is designed to provide Fellows with the financial freedom and the intellectual and professional environment to pursue their promising experimental ideas and new design approaches in a focused way.
Fellowship projects challenge existing building codes and conventions in the construction sector through design and building practice. Through collaborative practice, the fellowship projects bring together emerging actors, experts, students, and local stakeholders. They aim to produce new knowledge on local, biobased, and circular building, bridging the gap between institutional research and building practice to contribute to the development of a powerful aesthetic for a sustainable architecture of the future.
BE-FELLOW welcomes a broad spectrum of emerging international practitioners in the fields of architecture, design and engineering, art, as well as interdisciplinary constellations of architectural production.
Fellowship projects are framed by clear research questions and typically target the production of architectural artifacts of manageable scale that serve as tangible and measurable demonstrations of new ways of building. They should aim for longevity and to be integrated in a real-world, social context.
Projects are open-ended and designed for a duration of 3 to 12 months. They are developed and implemented in close collaboration between the Fellows and BE-FELLOW team and further project-specific partners in an open and shared research environment. Fellows are encouraged to spend as much time as possible in Berlin and in the LAB and office space at Marienpark. The Fellows’ presence in Berlin and Brandenburg is linked to exhibitions, lectures, symposia, and debates.
Fellows receive financial support for the implementation of the project on the basis of their project specific calculation included in the application form (approx. 4000€/month).

Celebrating in a place of mourning? How can the culturally pleasurable be compatible with the act of commemoration? KREMA-Festival dares to place art as an interface between the living and the dead. Last year’s programme included, for example, an amuse bouche of transience: celery heads charred in coal, a mourning ritual for queer ancestors packaged as stand-up comedy, an organ work composed especially for the organ of the Small Chapel, and a Hindu priest’s fire ceremony.
KREMA-Festival 2023 invites up to 15 artistic proposals that dare to locate themselves at an interface between life and death and simultaneously illuminate the site of the crematorium in a creative way. These contributions may be in the form of exhibitions, installations, performances, concerts, workshops, or other more hybrid forms.
The festival offers:
Artist fee of 1000 CHF.
Travel expenses (not included in the expenses is the transport of works; any expenses in this regard need to be discussed upon request).
If necessary, accommodation in Bern
The opportunity to place your work into relation with a crematorium.","","","<div id=block-otm-content class=""block block-system block-system-main-block""><article role=article about=/news/open-call-krema-festival-bern-crematorium-switzerland class=""node node--type-news-calls node--promoted node--view-mode-full""><div class=node__content><div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item""><p>During three days from 11-13 August 2023 the old crematorium in Bern, its surrounding urn corridors, as well as the two chapels will be activated with a multi-layered festival programme.</p><p>Celebrating in a place of mourning?

‘BETA CIRCUS Participatory experience’ aims to create a European transnational opportunity to explore the participatory circus as a future trend that can engage the public in circus’ creative process, letting audiences become co-authors, editors, and observers of artistic work.
BETA CIRCUS Participatory experience activities are scheduled in between 2023 and 2025, taking place in 4 European countries: Italy, Latvia, Portugal and Serbia. The methodology is divided into 2 main steps: first the participants will join 2 artistic laboratories (3 days each) and after the capacity building actions each artistic collective will join a local artistic organisation to implement an artistic experience in one partner country, with the support of one expert mentor (~3 weeks).
BETA CIRCUS Participatory experience is open to:
Individuals or circus arts collectives (up to 4 people) with or without experience in participatory circus but interested to join the participatory arts methodology and test it applied to circus arts. Applications will be accepted from all the European Union countries, as well as other countries currently eligible for Creative Europe Programme.
Artistic collectives (up to 4 people) from Italy, Latvia, Portugal and Serbia with experience in participatory arts and interested to join the project and test it applied to circus arts.
Each selected participant (single artist or group) will attend without costs the capacity building programme of BETA CIRCUS Participatory experience, as well as the mentoring programme with the designated expert mentor. The project covers travel expenses for designated activities (up to 300€ per person per trip), accommodation, and meals for the artistic laboratories. BETA CIRCUS partners will pay 3500€ to each selected artistic proposal.","","","<div id=block-otm-content class=""block block-system block-system-main-block""><article role=article about=/news/beta-circus-open-call-circus-artists-participatory-artists-italy-latvia-portugal-serbia class=""node node--type-news-calls node--promoted node--view-mode-full""><div class=node__content><div class=""clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item""><p><span class=caps>BETA</span> <span class=caps>CIRCUS</span> aims to address new trends in contemporary circus and to offset the lack of opportunities for artists to get trained at a high professional level. </p><p>‘<span class=caps>BETA</span> <span class=caps>CIRCUS</span> Participatory experience’ aims to create a European transnational opportunity to explore the participatory circus as a future trend that can engage the public in circus’ creative process, letting audiences become co-authors, editors, and observers of artistic work. </p><p><span class=caps>BETA</span> <span class=caps>CIRCUS</span> Participatory experience activities are scheduled in between 2023 and 2025, taking place in 4 European countries: Italy, Latvia, Portugal and Serbia.
