General Fund for Cultural and Artistic Mobility
In the framework of its mission to support mobility, the Roberto Cimetta Fund allocates on demand mobility grants, to meet the needs of cultural professionals and artists in the Mediterranean.
Aiming at promoting inclusive mobility, the Roberto Cimetta Fund gives priority to candidates with little access to mobility and/or who are poorly inserted into international cultural circuits. This call for applications for a travel grant is thus dedicated to women artists and cultural professionals from the southern and eastern shores of the Mediterranean, who are willing to travel within the southern Mediterranean region for south-south mobility (North Africa and the Middle East). The mobility must be completed before September 2023.
The purpose of the mobility must be one of the following:
Preparation of a professional level project.
Participation in a research or creation residency.
Presence at a meeting of artists or professionals with the objective of networking between cultural, artistic and development actors.
Artistic and professional training/education (internships, masterclasses, exchanges, study trips) or participation as a speaker or a trainer.
Attendance at debates, conferences, seminars.
A lump sum will be awarded to the winners: between 500€ and 700€ per grant, allowing cover (at least partially) for the costs related to mobility in general: tickets, visas, accommodation, etc. This call will deliver between 12 and 20 grants. Grants will be allocated after the trip, upon presentation of supporting documents, a written report, and visuals.
deadline: 30 December 2022

Call for : Something Foreign
“No Discipline” is a state of playful heart and free-spirit in mind when engaging in creation. It dares to explore ways of expression and presentation without the burden of boundaries.
No Discipline Limited (Hong Kong) aims to open up imagination and creativity for wider variety of cross-disciplinary collaborations. One of its initiatives is to foster an international residence programme (as laboratory for arts & creative exchange) in Hong Kong. In a hope to generate synergy for more cross-media experiment and cross-cultural collaboration.
Open call: ‘Foreign’ does not only describe something from abroad, but also relate to objects and conditions that appear as unfamiliar, unaccustomed and unexplored. As the start of a dialogue and exchange, ‘Something Foreign’ brings about inspirations from things external to one’s original experience, simply out of the unknown.
‘Something Foreign’, as the programme title itself suggests, works as a ‘foreign-er’ to generate and aggregate a collective of curiosities and senses among artists and cultural practitioners who would reset themselves to observe, listen and reflect. Journeying through the uncharted waters, we hope to (re)discover something new, and to venture out to an unimagined fathom.
‘Something Foreign’ seeks to bolster and renew inspiration to local arts community by importing ‘foreign things’. Our dedicated International Artists-in-Residence programme is scoped to bring in unfamiliar and unexpected ideas, practices and cultures.
The programme serve as a platform for cross-cultural dialogue, for sharing of identities, values and visions, in the shaping of arts. It provides opportunity to build lasting connections on ideas and experience sharing between people.

The Black Artists Grant
The Black Artists Grant (BAG) offered by Creative Debuts as a no-strings attached financial support to help black artists. They can spend the grant on whatever they want – be that make new work, buy equipment or materials, travel, research, visit exhibitions or conferences, or to even just cover some life expenses.
This grant has been set up because black artists are systematically under-supported by the art world; by institutions, curators, the artist-led scene, major and minor funding bodies, the market, art schools, and by audiences too.
Creative Debuts recognises that a full institutional overhaul and dismantling of racist structures is required to transform the industry permanently, but they hope in a small way that this grant will help enable recipients to continue their artistic practice when the odds are so stacked against them.
–
Before you apply, please read the grant details below:
· Applicants must be based in the UK.
· This is specifically for Black artists; not politically black, not POC or BAME.
· Recipients will be chosen monthly by a Creative Debuts selector partner
· Every few months this selector will change. Follow us on Instagram for regular updates in relation to our selectors.
· Each successful recipient will receive £500
· There is no deadline as this is a monthly rolling grant, no age limit, and the grant does not expect any outcomes or reporting. Please only apply once, if you apply in February for example, you are still eligible for selection in a different month, all applications are kept and reviewed
· The grant is currently supported by Creative Debuts, Most Wanted Wines, and Artquest. We are always open to having new sponsors join the team. If this is of interest, please email calum@creativedebuts.co.uk

The Faces Behind Typefaces
Typography, as language made visible, is a fundamental adhesive that connects all of us. Typography, as a profession, is a powerful international community of practitioners who learn from and inspire each other.
Since its launch in 1946, the Type Directors Club (TDC) has helped the industry consolidate through educational activities and showcasing the best of the best. This editorial, coinciding with the 75th anniversary of the club, explores the impact of the older generation of TDC medalists with first-hand stories from today’s most active members.
With a rich history, the TDC aims to amplify the power of typography and serve a global community that believes type drives culture and culture drives type.
Starting out with 20 members in New York, as of 2022 the organization brings together a membership of over 800 type designers and typographers from 36 countries and tens of hundreds of subscribers. Today, 75 years after its founding, the TDC is the world’s leading global typography organization.
To honor this special occasion, Readymag created a web space for meaningful dialogue between generations of typographers, connecting prominent figures in type design. The Faces Behind Typefaces is a deep dive into the impact and legacy of the TDC Medal and the past medalists.

Call for Women Visual Artists
Theme: Roots: Interconnectivity, Healing, and Strength
My invitation to women artists:
I’m an artist whose environmental themed sculptures have been exhibited in solo and group shows across the United States and internationally. This year, I’m excited to launch a collaborative project for women artists around the world to participate in my
Roots Exhibition
… and I hope you will join me!
My inspiration – trees!
In this era of distrust, conflict, alienation, and extinction, I look to the remarkable healing power of nature, especially trees. Standing among trees, I am in awe of their size, age, beauty, and ability to survive.
I’ve been learning about trees and their underground connection through roots. This huge ancient network supports and nourishes their species, as well as other plants in their community.
Trees show us the way
We humans can learn a lot from trees. There’s much that our own species can do to take care of our earth and environment – our home – as an imperative for survival. We’re connected to each other through our roots, our heritage, our families, and our migrations.
What do roots mean to you?
Amidst the current climate crisis, it’s not only helpful, but imperative to reflect and connect through art – visual, written, or sound. I’m asking women artists to think about roots and collaborate with me about what roots mean to them or inspire them. My intention is to connect us with each other from around the globe.
Interested in participating?
I invite women artists internationally to send your digital images, poems, drawings, and photographs to be included in an:
Exhibition in 2023 at Dominican University, San Rafael, California
No payment or fees involved
ENTRY DETAILS:
• DEADLINE FOR ENTRY: DECEMBER 31, 2022 ( ENSURE YOUR MATERIAL ARRIVES BEFORE DECEMBER 31, 2022)
• SEND YOUR DIGITAL submissions no larger than 1 MB, POEMS, DRAWINGS, AND PHOTOGRAPHS TO: marguerite.elliot@gmail.com
• NO IMAGES WILL BE SOLD.
• IF YOU WANT TO SEND ORIGINAL MATERIAL, PLEASE EMAIL ME FOR ADDRESS. I AM UNABLE TO RETURN PHYSICAL ENTRIES.
• YOU WILL RECEIVE FULL DETAILS ABOUT THE EVENT, AND DOCUMENTATION OF YOUR CONTRIBUTION WHEN IT IS EXHIBITED.
LET’S STAY ROOTED!

Open Call for Artists and Curators
CUE’s Open Calls provide artists and emerging curators the opportunity and necessary resources to realize an exhibition at CUE’s storefront gallery in East Chelsea, New York.
Each year, a panel of established artists and curators select three solo exhibitions and one curatorial project to be realized at CUE. Finalists are paired with a member of the selection panel, who works with them as a mentor throughout the process of planning and mounting the exhibition. CUE provides institutional guidance, generous honoraria, a shipping budget, and an accompanying exhibition catalogue with a critical essay by a participant in CUE’s Art Critic Mentoring Program.
Applications are accepted once annually. The 2022 Open Calls will open in February; please check back for more information or subscribe to our mailing list for updates. If you have any questions please contact us at opencall@cueartfoundation.org.
ABOUT THE EXHIBITION PROGRAM
CUE aims to present new and exceptionally strong work by under-recognized and emerging artists based in the United States, and is committed to exhibiting contemporary work of all disciplines.
The exhibition selection process consists of a nomination and open call hybrid, with three types of opportunities for artists and emerging curators. This includes a series of Nominated Solo Exhibitions, a Solo Exhibition Open Call, and a Curatorial Project Open Call. In line with CUE’s commitment to providing substantive professional development opportunities, exhibiting artists and curators receive mentorship support throughout the process of planning, promoting, and curating the exhibition.

Open call for exhibition
We are:
Ex-room is a non-commercial project and exhibition space, located in an old factory building in Copenhagen, Denmark. We are 20 artists who work there on a daily basis. The exhibition space is managed by 5 artists from the studio. Since 2015, Eks-Rummet has presented both new and more experienced artists from the international as well as the national scene. Every year in November, Eks-Rummet has an Open Call that all artists can apply for.
Practical details:
• The exhibition period runs from February to November.
• A deposit of DKK 500 must be paid, which will be refunded if the Ex-Room is returned in the same condition as it was received.
• Make sure you have DKK 200 with you when you receive the key. You do not get these back, but go to the general maintenance of the Ex-Room.
• If you get an exhibition in the Ex-Room, it will last for 10 days. We expect you to hold a vernissage on the first day (Thursday), but otherwise it is up to you how many of these 10 days you want to keep open.
ATTENTION! You must look after the exhibition yourself, this is important.
What we offer:
Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee visitors and do not provide any form of financial support. But what we offer, on the other hand, is an exhibition venue where you get reasonable freedom to try out some exhibition ideas. We will also provide practical information and advice on arrival and during the exhibition set-up, as well as do PR on social media and a few other platforms, if these accept the press release.
How to apply:
You must send us an exhibition description (max one A4 page), as well as a CV and a small digital portfolio of previous works.
The application is sent to: eksrummet@gmail.com. The application can be in both Danish and English.

for painters, sculptors and artists who work on paper, including printmakers
Pollock-Krasner grants have enabled artists to create new work, purchase needed materials and pay for studio rent, as well as their personal expenses. Past recipients of Pollock-Krasner grants acknowledge their critical impact in allowing concentrated time for studio work, and in preparing for exhibitions and other professional opportunities such as accepting a residency.
PURPOSE
The Foundation provides financial resources for visual artists to create new work, acquire supplies, rent studio space, prepare for exhibitions, attend a residency and offset living expenses.
APPLICATION GUIDELINES
The Foundation welcomes, throughout the year, applications from visual artists who are painters, sculptors and artists who work on paper, including printmakers. There are no deadlines. Grants are intended for a one-year period of time. The Foundation will review expenditures relating to an artist’s professional work and personal expenses and amounts range up to $30,000. The size of the grant is determined by the individual circumstances of the artist. Professional exhibition history will be taken into consideration. Artists must be actively exhibiting their current work in professional artistic venues, such as gallery and museum spaces.
GRANT RESTRICTIONS
The Foundation does not accept applications from commercial artists, graphic artists, video artists, performance artists, filmmakers, crafts-makers, or any artist whose work primarily falls into these categories. The Foundation does not have an open photography grant program. The Foundation does not make grants to students or fund academic study. The Foundation does not make grants to pay for past debts, legal fees or personal travel.
SELECTION PROCESS
The Officers and Directors are advised in the selection process by a Committee of Selection comprised of recognized specialists in the fields of the Foundation’s concern. Artists are required to submit a cover letter, an application, and images of current work. Professional exhibition history will be taken into consideration. All completed applications will be promptly acknowledged and considered. If further information is required after the completed application has been received, the artist will be contacted directly by the staff. Further information including financial data may be requested at any time during the review process. The application process can take from nine months to a year.

(google translated)
The Kunsthaus Mitte in Oberhausen is a central location of Oberhausen’s art and culture scene. The transdisciplinary orientation of the house opens up freedom for artists and practice-oriented scientists of all disciplines to (further) develop their own work and research projects. At the same time, the house is an important meeting and interaction space for all citizens of the city. The residency program therefore explicitly promotes the interlinking of artistic practice, education and science as well as active interventions with the institutions, associations and residents of Oberhausen. This thematic focus of the program results from the self-image of being an artistic and cultural platform for urban society.
Application requirements
Professionally working artists and/or artist groups and scientists from the fields of performing arts, fine arts, music, film, literature, practice-oriented science, research and education residing in NRW can apply. The residency program was created to promote work at the interface between art and society. The Kunsthaus Mitte in Oberhausen is therefore particularly interested in city-specific projects with a longer-term effect.
There is no age limit. There is a residency obligation for the duration of the residency program at the Kunsthaus Mitte. Students are excluded.
Residency formats and duration
Two different residency formats are advertised:
+ One-month residencies designed for projects whose orientation has not yet been formulated. In this context, for example, research, working sketches or experimental approaches can be pursued.
+ Two-month residencies are planned for the realization of more extensive projects. The targeted implementation ideally ends with a public exhibition, presentation, performance or other artistic actions.
The programs differ not only in the duration but also in the scope of the financial support.
The one-month artist residency includes the following services:
– a furnished living/working studio
– a grant of €1,000
– Travel allowance of 200€
The two-month artist residency includes the following services:
– a furnished living/working studio
– a grant of €2,500
– a reimbursement of material costs up to 500€
– Travel allowance of 200€
In your application, please state the preferred duration of the residency (one or two months) and at least one period as a preference.
The Kunsthaus Mitte supports all residents in their work processes and promotes artistic exchange with other users of the building, municipal institutions and the citizens of the city.

Climate Cultures Call
In order to be able to effectively counteract climate change, we need to change our mindset. What is needed are holistic approaches that take into account the connection between global warming and social climate – and from this obtain incentives for the urgently needed transformation of our cultural practices and paradigms. Along with the ecological aspects, consequences of the climate crisis such as social upheaval, displacement and migration, and growing nationalism must also be considered.
The Allianz Foundation’s Climate Cultures Call supports projects and initiatives that are situated at the intersection between climate and culture, and work toward sustainable solutions for open societies and a healthy and habitable planet.
The open call is aimed at actors from the civil society, arts and culture, and environmental protection sectors. Allianz Foundation explicitly welcome applications from members of younger generations as well as from people or organisations that work across borders and/or do outreach work with target groups that are especially diverse.
Ten projects will be funded in which artists, cultural workers, activists, environmentalists, citizens’ initiatives, NGOs, scientists, start-ups or urban planners from Europe and the Mediterranean establish alliances for a new climate culture.
Allianz Foundation are looking for projects:
That establish new alliances for fighting the climate crisis in a way that includes social and cultural perspectives.
That create new narratives that make the necessary socio-ecological change tangible as a benefit and motivate more people to take action for the climate.
That include many voices and take intersectional, cross-generational or postcolonial perspectives into account, among others.
That raise questions about justice for the societies of the present and for future generations.
Projects can be funded for up to 50,000 euros. The funding period is 15 March – 31 December 2023. The Climate Cultures Call is a special call responding to the urgency of the current challenges. The applications are quickly reviewed, and funding will be awarded expediently. If we don’t act today, the risks for the future will become incalculable.
deadline: 1 January 2023

Call for ‘Gardens of the world in motion’ (google translated)
Since the Earth Summit in Johannesburg in 2002, culture has become the 4th pillar of sustainable development, alongside the social, economic and environmental dimensions. A factor of peace, diversity and social cohesion, culture also plays an essential role in raising awareness and transmitting values. The Cité internationale universitaire de Paris, which welcomes students and researchers from all over the world in a multicultural environment, has chosen contemporary creation to support its sustainable development project.
The objective of the “Gardens of the World in Motion” project is to make the public of the Cité internationale aware of the rich heritage of the site, the dialogue that architecture maintains with the landscape and the ecological dimension of its park, in a context creative international.
With the support of Caisse des Dépôts patronage, the Cité internationale offers professionals and young talents the opportunity to break out of the usual project management format to appropriate a landscaped space, equip it with a creative project, committed and ephemeral.
The public will be led to apprehend the works in this context of cultural exchanges, of dialogue between architecture and landscape, while being made aware of the challenges of sustainable development.
A scholarship in the amount of €8,000 will be awarded to each selected participant.
The selected candidates undertake to install their works by May 3, 2023 at 10 a.m. A workspace will be made available to participants for their creations from March 15, 2023.
deadline: 6 January 2023

Call for Long Stay Program 2022-2023
Theme: PUZZLING POLY+SEMY
PARADISE AIR is an artist-in-residence program located in Matsudo, Chiba Prefecture, conveniently close to yet comfortably removed from the bustle of central Tokyo. The program is held on the vacant floors of a former hotel, a setting afforded to us by the Rakuen pachinko parlor (a pinball-gambling establishment) that occupies the bottom floors of this building owned by Hamatomo Corporation. We launched the program in 2013, naming ourselves PARADISE AIR after this “Rakuen” – “paradise” in English – combined with “AIR,” the acronym for “artist-in-residence.”
Artist-in-residence programs provide artists a place to stay and create art for a given period, supporting their travel and artistic activities. Situated along the old Mito Road, Matsudo thrived during the Edo Period (1603–1868) as one of the route’s “post towns”– stop-off points punctuating major roads – where travelers would stay on their journey between Edo (present-day Tokyo) and Mito. Countless travelers came and went past where Matsudo station stands today, including artists – poets, painters, calligraphers and the like – who would sometimes leave pieces of their own art as payment for lodging. Some of these works can still be found today, preserved in local residents’ homes. In the spirit of this Matsudo tradition, PARADISE AIR operates under the concept of “One Stay, One Art,” and is accumulating its own history as a cultural and artistic transit point where visitors, both from Japan and overseas, can stop off along their artistic journeys.
At present, our activities revolve around three programs: the SHORTSTAY Program, open not just to artists but to curators and researchers too; the LONGSTAY Program, which hosts artists chosen from among applicants for three months, offering all-round support that covers travel, accommodation, language, and of course artistic production; and finally the LEARN Program, which connects artists with the city, encouraging different kinds of learning and interaction. Our goal is to update and add new layers to Matsudo’s culture by letting our artists stretch their wings across the whole city, working in concert with the local residents.
—
AIR Period: October to December, 2023. A residency of at least 70 days and up to 90 days is possible during this period.
A word, a name, a work contains multiple coexisting meanings, to each encounter a different interpretation that overflows the capacity to hold. Yet this was designed,
—every puzzle piece I place out of my own volition, I believe that’s true,
my reaction to flirtation—
Worlds are falling apart again, eyes following one sun, detours breaking glass falling out of order, grasping hints from the past and throwing shards of light now.
Applicants must meet the following conditions:
Enjoy engaging in dialogue with the town
Currently living and working in the wider arts field, contributing to the contemporary creation of art
(“Contributing to the contemporary creation of art” is not only limited to artists pursuing research and creative activities, but also includes the research, lectures, or symposiums created by people working in relation to art)
Be willing and able to engage in genuine cultural exchange with other residence artists and local residents during the term of residency
Be in good physical and mental health
Be able to positively manage the program in accordance with the situation regarding diseases, travel and immigration
Have flexibility regarding program scheduling, rules, and administration
Be able to conduct everyday conversation in Japanese and/or English
Offered by the residency:
【For Selected Finalists】
Production costs of video letter: ¥30,000 per group (payable only via Paypal, including handling fees)
【For Residence Artist】

The program is held on the vacant floors of a former hotel, a setting afforded to us by the Rakuen pachinko parlor (a pinball-gambling establishment) that occupies the bottom floors of this building owned by Hamatomo Corporation. We launched the program in 2013, naming ourselves PARADISE AIR after this “Rakuen” – “paradise” in English – combined with “AIR,” the acronym for “artist-in-residence.”</p><p>Artist-in-residence programs provide artists a place to stay and create art for a given period, supporting their travel and artistic activities. Situated along the old Mito Road, Matsudo thrived during the Edo Period (1603–1868) as one of the route’s “post towns”– stop-off points punctuating major roads – where travelers would stay on their journey between Edo (present-day Tokyo) and Mito. Countless travelers came and went past where Matsudo station stands today, including artists – poets, painters, calligraphers and the like – who would sometimes leave pieces of their own art as payment for lodging. Some of these works can still be found today, preserved in local residents’ homes. In the spirit of this Matsudo tradition, PARADISE AIR operates under the concept of “One Stay, One Art,” and is accumulating its own history as a cultural and artistic transit point where visitors, both from Japan and overseas, can stop off along their artistic journeys.</p><p>At present, our activities revolve around three programs: the SHORTSTAY Program, open not just to artists but to curators and researchers too; the LONGSTAY Program, which hosts artists chosen from among applicants for three months, offering all-round support that covers travel, accommodation, language, and of course artistic production; and finally the LEARN Program, which connects artists with the city, encouraging different kinds of learning and interaction. Our goal is to update and add new layers to Matsudo’s culture by letting our artists stretch their wings across the whole city, working in concert with the local residents.</p><p>—</p><p>AIR Period: October to December, 2023. A residency of at least 70 days and up to 90 days is possible during this period.</p><p>A word, a name, a work contains multiple coexisting meanings, to each encounter a different interpretation that overflows the capacity to hold. Yet this was designed,</p><p>—every puzzle piece I place out of my own volition, I believe that’s true,<br> my reaction to flirtation—</p><p>Worlds are falling apart again, eyes following one sun, detours breaking glass falling out of order, grasping hints from the past and throwing shards of light now.</p><p>Applicants must meet the following conditions:</p><p>Enjoy engaging in dialogue with the town<br> Currently living and working in the wider arts field, contributing to the contemporary creation of art<br> (“Contributing to the contemporary creation of art” is not only limited to artists pursuing research and creative activities, but also includes the research, lectures, or symposiums created by people working in relation to art)<br> Be willing and able to engage in genuine cultural exchange with other residence artists and local residents during the term of residency<br> Be in good physical and mental health<br> Be able to positively manage the program in accordance with the situation regarding diseases, travel and immigration<br> Have flexibility regarding program scheduling, rules, and administration<br> Be able to conduct everyday conversation in Japanese and/or English<br> Offered by the residency:</p><p>【For Selected Finalists】</p><p>Production costs of video letter: ¥30,000 per group (payable only via Paypal, including handling fees)</p><p>【For Residence Artist】</p><p>Accommodation (PARADISE AIR), Matsudo, Chiba, Japan<br> Transportation for one round trip from the artist’s place of residence to Matsudo (while transportation for artists living in Japan is not limited to one round trip, a maximum limit applies for total transportation costs)<br> ¥200,000 for production costs per group<br> Per diem: ¥3000 x number of days of residence, per group (cash)<br> Costs associated with equipment and transportation of artwork<br> Arrangement of venues for the presentation of work and coordination of events<br> Local support for daily life and production of work<br> Arrangement of transportation to Matsudo and supply information on current regulations for entering the country<br> Costs associated with publicity</p><p><strong>deadline</strong>: January 6th (Fri) 24:00 (JST)<br><strong>more info</strong>:</p><p>—</p></div></div>"

Call for Street Art Installations
The Valletta Cultural Agency (Malta) is inviting artists to submit one or more artistic proposals for street installations, as part of its 2023 cultural programme. This call aims to celebrate the power of art in public places, transforming the streets into a fun and colorful artistic installation, through works of art that harmoniously blend with urban environments open to passers-by.
Two installations will be selected for display in South Street, Valletta. The first installation chosen must be installed by the 3 March 2023, and the second installation chosen must be installed by the 3 November 2023 (this proposal must create a warm end-of-the year feeling of festivity and hospitality).
The Agency are interested in proposals for artistic installations which:
Are colourful and/or impactful and attractive, both during the day and at night.
Are inspired by Valletta: its history, present, old and new traditions, architecture, etc.
Are sturdy enough to be on display for 4 months and can withstand weather conditions such as strong sun, wind and possible rain showers.
Are installed overhead, allowing people to safely walk underneath while not obstructing the narrow streets.
Are physical, not digital. Designs which include a multi-sensory effect will be considered a plus. The design must respect the fact that this is a residential area.
Are environmentally conscious in their implementation, including in the choice of materials. The use of plastic is discouraged unless it is re-used or recycled and a plan is in hand for its environmentally conscious disposal at the end of the display period. Materials may include metal, wood, glass, textile, ceramic, lights etc.
Irreversible interventions in the street or the building facades, including installing nails or bolts, are strictly prohibited.
The Agency is allocating up to 14,000 EUR inclusive of VAT for each selected project. Although most of the production will be in the Agency’s hands, the applicant is required to provide an estimate within the application to show that the proposed installation can be carried out within the available budget. The estimate must include:
Artist/s fees.
Procurement of materials.
Transportation, labour and installation costs (including high up trucks).
Technical equipment such as lighting.
Accommodation and travel for international artists, if required.
Other production costs including freight, any licensing fee.
deadline: 7 January 2023

The Foundation supports contemporary artists by offering them the opportunity to create a site specific artwork that will not only become part of its collection, but will join an important cultural heritage as well.

The prize calls for site-specific large-scale works created to be part of a specific, configured environment; works which narrate an internal path/route, and which can be reference points/landmarks within their exhibition space. Particular emphasis is also placed on the theme of Care/Eudaimonia, which was the theme of the new G. & A. Mamidakiss Foundation residency program (October 2022).
Applications are open to international artists. Three proposals in total will be selected, with each artist recieving 7,000 Euros, and an additional 7,000 Euros will be made available to each artist for the construction of the work. The selected works will remain on permanent display in Agios Nikolaos, Crete, and will become part of the Foundation’s art collection.
The Art Prize, now in its third year, aspires to support and promote the advancement of artistic creativity and excellence. It supports artists with the production of new works as well as the incorporation of these works in a permanent collection. The Foundation’s collection brings together artworks by important Greek and international artists, including Magdalena Abakanowicz, Lynda Benglis, Costas Varotsos, Maria Loizidou, Rena Papaspyrou, Angelos Skourtis, Kostas Ioannidis, Nikos Alexiou, George Lappas, Giorgos Gyparakis, Georgia Kotretsos, Theodoros Zafeiropoulos, Yorgos Rimenidis, Ileana Arnaoutou, and Ismene King.

Call for Playwrights and Dramatic Texts
Blaagaard Teater (Denmark) is organising the international reading festival Pink Pavilion in May 2023 in collaboration with the development platform for new writing. Pink Pavilion is looking for playwrights who are interested in having an excerpt of their finished work read.
What is Pink Pavilion? Pink Pavilion is a festival where both Danish and international theatre artists can come together around new dramatic writing that gives us more angles on a shared, global world. The festival contributes to the internationalisation of the performing arts, where the performing arts community and the theatre industry can experience other cultures, have conventions, and learn about traditions. The festival will be held in a safe, relaxed and festive setting at Blaagaard Teater in Copenhagen and at Teater Katapult in Aarhus on 11, 12 and 13 May 2023.
An excerpt from your script will be chosen to suit a 30 minute staged reading. This extract will be translated into Danish and possibly English. The excerpt will be worked on in a 4-day rehearsal period with a director and up to 4 actors. Pink Pavilion will buy the rights for performing your play. The assignment is paid and the organisers cover your stay in Copenhagen and your transport costs.
This year’s theme is POWER, in all its forms: political, personal, human and social. The work you apply with must be connected in some way to the theme – it can be both in a literal sense or a loose association. The work you are applying with must have been performed previously or be in its completed form.
deadline: 10 January 2023

This extract will be translated into Danish and possibly English. The excerpt will be worked on in a 4-day rehearsal period with a director and up to 4 actors. Pink Pavilion will buy the rights for performing your play. The assignment is paid and the organisers cover your stay in Copenhagen and your transport costs.</p><p>This year’s theme is POWER, in all its forms: political, personal, human and social. The work you apply with must be connected in some way to the theme – it can be both in a literal sense or a loose association. The work you are applying with must have been performed previously or be in its completed form.</p><p><strong>deadline</strong>: 10 January 2023<br><strong>more info</strong>: <a href=https://blaagaardteater.dk/program/pink-pavilion>https://blaagaardteater.dk/program/pink-pavilion</a></p><p>—</p><p> </p><p> </p></div></div>"

Four-year residencies at six wetlands restoration sites in Europe
The WaterLANDS project is calling for applications from artists of any discipline in Bulgaria, Estonia, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands and the United Kingdom to engage with restoration works through part-time residencies spanning four years (at least one month annually, 2023–2026).
WaterLANDS is a five-year EU Green Deal-funded project that aims to restore damaged wetlands across Europe and lay the foundations for protection across larger areas. The project will utilise lessons learned from ongoing and existing restoration at 15 ‘Knowledge Sites’ across Europe to inform hands-on restoration at six ‘Action Sites’ in Bulgaria, Estonia, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands and the United Kingdom.
The aim is for the artist to reflect on the restoration work ongoing at the site, as well as broader social processes, by interacting with relevant stakeholders and communities, including an instance of engagement or outreach each year.
The artist is requested to create an artwork(s) inspired by the restoration activities by the end of the final year, although the form this can take is very open. The project will culminate with an exhibition in 2026, where accounts of the six artistic engagements will be exhibited.
What this opportunity offers
Artistic fee (depending on the country), travel, stakeholder engagement and materials costs (to be agreed in advance)
Working with a host institution(s) who will support and manage their residency. There will also be a coordinator based in University College Dublin who will support the artists and facilitate cross-pollination and communication across the six sites.
Internal travel costs, basic accommodation and daily allowance during the residency stay
There may be the opportunity for funded travel to one or more of the other Action Sites
deadline: 13 January 2022

Bad Taste: confronting the role of industrial food in the climate crisis
Bad Taste is a Greenpeace project funding creative ideas that confront the role of the UK’s industrial food system in the climate crisis. UK-based artists and activists are invited to devise artworks, creative actions and interventions in places of public, political and corporate structural power.
Three projects will be supported with grants of 10,000 GBP, a separate production budget and a box of ash from burnt Amazon rainforest.
In recognition that there are inequities built into the industrial food system, this project prioritises the perspectives of artists and activists who self-identify as Black, Indigenous, people of colour and/or working class. We welcome people identifying as disabled and neurodivergent, and will support access needs wherever possible.
The ash represents the damage and violence that underpin industrial meat and dairy. Climate-critical forests across Brazil are burnt for the expansion of animal agriculture—displacing and destroying Indigenous Peoples’ lives.
Even if fossil fuel use ended today, without significantly reducing meat and dairy, emissions from the global food system alone would make it impossible to limit warming to one and a half degrees celsius.
Greenpeace is calling for a reduction of industrial meat and dairy in the UK of 70 percent by 2030. The transition away from industrial meat and dairy requires support to be in place for farmers to produce food more sustainably for all; stopping imports of all agricultural commodities like animal feed that are linked to the destruction of forests overseas; freeing up land to restore nature in the UK; a commitment to ensuring accessible, affordable, nutritious food that respects cultural and religious traditions; and adequate support for households on the lowest incomes.
This project sits at the intersection of art and activism to foster imaginative strategies that create change. It’s the first time Greenpeace has fully opened up its action design process.

Artist Residency Program
The Helene Wurlitzer Foundation of New Mexico is a private, non-profit, educational and charitable organization committed to supporting the arts.
Founded in 1954, the HWF manages one of the oldest artist residency programs in the USA. The Foundation’s mission is to “Support the artist and the creative process” and serves as a haven for visual artists, literary artists and music composers.
The Helene Wurlitzer Foundation is located on fifteen acres in the heart of Taos, New Mexico, a multicultural community renowned for its popularity with artists.
About Helene:
Helene Wurlitzer has remained an enigma to many for over half a century, due in great part to the fact that she chose to remain anonymous, and that her many philanthropic works, which contributed to the betterment of humanity, be kept private.
So who was Helene Wurlitzer, and how did she end up in Taos, New Mexico? When did she establish the Helene Wurlitzer Foundation of New Mexico, and for what purpose? Who has benefited from her Foundation, and who continues to benefit?
As part of our 2021 capital campaign we will answer these questions, and break the enigma surrounding the HWF, as we invite you to Meet Helene.
Artist Residency Program
The Foundation offers three months of rent-free and utility-paid housing to people who specialize in the creative arts. Our eleven artist casitas, or guest houses, are fully furnished and provide residents with a peaceful setting in which to pursue their creative endeavors.
The Foundation accepts applications from painters, poets, sculptors, writers, playwrights, screenwriters, composers, photographers, and filmmakers of national and international origin.
Applications are reviewed by a selection committee consisting of professionals who specialize in the artistic discipline of the applicant. Numerous jurors serve on committees for each: visual arts, music composers, writers, poets, playwrights, and filmmakers. Jurors, who know nothing about the artist’s demographics, score in five categories based purely on the merit of the applicant’s creative work samples.
Artists in residence have no imposed expectations, quotas, or requirements during their stay on the HWF campus. The HWF’s residency program provides artists with the time and space to create, which in turn enriches the artistic community and culture locally and abroad.
application fee: Yes : 25$

Open Call for Contemporary Art and Architecture
minus20degree is a contemporary art and architecture exhibition that takes place every two years in Flachau, Austria during winter. The exhibition lasts for three days in January.
They are now looking for artists in the field of sound art, video art, performance, theatre, installation, or dynamic land art for their 2024 edition.
They are especially interested in art that takes and needs space, art that is mobile or makes the audience move. They also look forward to receiving proposals for sound and video art that embraces the snowy landscape as an endless projection surface.
minus20degree provides outside space for art that is controversial, provocative, but grounded. minus20degree is completely independent, thus does not need to please or go easy on the audience.
All art works need to be conceptualized and produced especially for minus20degree.
The theme for 2024 is ‘Plateau’ – a concept with some latent ambiguity. As a geological formation, it is a part of the landscape the festival deals with as exhibition space, and at the same time it may be valid as an expression of societal stagnation and a description of our times.
– Application is open to individuals, pairs, or groups at any stage of their career.
minus20degree offers:
Artist fee of €1000.
Production budget of up to €1600.
Travel budget up to €400.
Up to 6 nights accommodation (arrangements for longer stays can be made).
Support from the team throughout m20d24.
Professional documentation of the work.

Steven Gerber Project Call for Scores (USA)
C4: The Choral Composer/Conductor Collective, a New York City-based new music chorus, invites composers, especially BIPoC composers, to submit unperformed choral works with a conceptual connection to William Shakespeare, to be performed on C4’s spring 2023 concert in New York City.
As part of an ongoing collaboration with the Steven R. Gerber Trust, C4 will be performing Steven Gerber’s Sessions of Sweet Silent Thought, a setting of five Shakespearean sonnets (9, 30, 71, 129 and 130). To foster new music, the Gerber Trust is providing support for one or two new pieces to be performed as part of the same concert. Additionally, there will be a dedicated recording session leading to high-quality recordings of both Sessions of Sweet Silent Thought and the accompanying piece or pieces.
A $1500 prize will be awarded for each selected piece. Additionally, a travel stipend of up to $500 is available for out-of-town composers who wish to attend the premiere, which will take place in May or June 2023.
Pieces to be considered should be about 4 to 10 minutes in length (these are not hard limits), and should not have been performed previously in public. They should tie into the theme of Shakespeare and his sonnets, but composers are free to experiment with the exact connection, anything from setting another (or even the same) sonnet, to examining what Shakespeare does and does not signify to the modern observer, and beyond. The composer must be able to show that they have rights to the text, if any.

The composer must be able to show that they have rights to the text, if any.</p><p><strong>deadline</strong>: 31 January 2023<br><strong>more info</strong>: <a href=http://www.c4ensemble.org/gerber-call-for-scores-2022-2023.html>http://www.c4ensemble.org/gerber-call-for-scores-2022-2023.html</a></p><p>—</p><p> </p><p> </p></div></div>"

Call for Artists
Calling “We are the people” and “No violence”, around 70,000 people gathered on October 9, 1989, to march along Leipzig’s inner city ring road, demonstrating for freedom and democracy and thus paving the way for the fall of the Wall, for the unity of Germany and Europe. The dramatic events of autumn 1989 still move people today.
For the 35th anniversary of the Peaceful Revolution on October 9, 2024, the Leipzig Festival of Lights is looking for outdoor artistic projects to be presented along Leipzig’s inner-city ring road
We are looking for projects that artistically take up the historical events of autumn ’89 in public space, reflect them in the current context and make them emotionally tangible.
Leipzig keeps the memory of the Peaceful Revolution alive in many ways. The culture of remembrance focuses on October 9 with the three central events of the Peace Prayer, Speech on Democracy and Leipzig Festival of Lights. Leipzig residents and guests of the city commemorate the historical events together at the original locations.
The Leipzig Festival of Lights, which has been held annually since 2009, has firmly established itself as an art and community project at the historic site in public space and inspires thousands of visitors of all generations. The format, which has won several national and international awards, keeps the event of the Peaceful Revolution of 1989 alive in people’s minds. In particular, the big anniversary events every 5 years enjoy international attention*.
Since 2009 the Peaceful Revolution has formed the common thematic thread whereas the participating artists change every year and sometimes implement their projects with local partners in a participatory manner. In addition, the Leipzig Festival of Lights maintains a strong international exchange. The aim of the event is to make the historical aspects of 1989 directly tangible in the present. The focus is on the central messages and democracy experiences of the Peaceful Revolution as well as their references to today, both nationally and internationally.
Application form can be requested by email: Lichtfest@ltm-leipzig.de

Call for storytellers focused on climate justice
The Doc Society Climate Story Fund supports compelling storytelling and impact campaigns from around the world that move us closer to a climate-just and biodiverse future.
The Climate Story Fund prioritizes climate stories centering the most affected, the unengaged and the underrepresented, and puts them at the center of the story. The Fund also prioritizes storytellers working in and from those communities, sharing narratives that resonate deeply with new and unengaged audiences, bringing them into critical conversations around climate justice.
The Doc Society is looking for creative nonfiction projects including long-form, shorts, or episodic documentaries as well as podcasts and radio documentaries, that can complete production in 2023 with support from the Climate Story Fund. The Fund also supports completed creative nonfiction and fiction projects of any medium looking to pilot an impact campaign in 2023 to engage audiences who are not typically included in the climate conversation
The Fund will support 6-8 projects with grants ranging between $50,000 to $100,000 per project.
eligibility:
All projects must be climate-themed with the intention to implement an impact campaign. We don’t need you to be an impact expert but open to the idea
To qualify for production funding, projects must complete production in 2023
To qualify for impact funding, projects must pilot an impact campaign in 2023
As part of our grant-making for this fund, we require all grantees to attend an Impact Lab to connect with impact producers and climate experts, to help develop impact strategies and to craft impact campaigns that are built upon existing expertise and advocacy efforts to engage their intended audiences. Project teams must be able to attend our virtual Impact Lab during the week of 5-9 June 2023
how to:
Applications must be submitted online via the Doc Society applications portal here

Illustrated Silent Book Contest 2023
The town of Mulazzo and the International Organisation of Book Towns present the eighth edition of the International Illustrated Silent Book Contest expressly dedicated to silent books, that is, illustrated books without words.

For each book project sent to the competition, a complete layout should be created. The layout must be a single digital file, exclusively in high-quality PDF format.
eligibility:
Open worldwide to illustrators over the age of 18.
prize:
The winning book project of the Silent Book Contest 2023 will be published by Carthusia Edizioni. The author will sign a regular publishing contract and receive a cash prize of 4.000 EUR (approx. 4,230 USD), as advance on the royalties.

Call for: Fibres
Seeking artistic responses to the theme of Fibres.
​
Textile making traditions spans global cultures as one of the earliest human technologies. It has been a staple in industry, fashion, craft and decorative arts throughout the ages but it particularly made a resurgence in the 1960s back into the contemporary art world. Since then Fibre and textile arts have been developing new forms and language -becoming more conceptual and cross-disciplinary, even into this digital age.
​
We’re are seeking works that explore (but are not limited to) the following areas:
Textiles (Fibre art, Ecology, Upcycling, Craft, Natural vs Synthetic materials, Traditional vs contemporary methods of making, Materiality, Cross-disciplinary art)
Technology (Fibre optics, making and machinery of modern textiles, video/film, animation, VR, 3D printing, digital responses to textiles and fibres)
We are particularly interested in works that cross over between the two but this is not essential. Works can explore their own themes but there must have a link to the idea of textiles, materiality or fibres in some form.
​This will accumulate in a group exhibition that will explore the the relationship between textiles and technology; between the ecology and the digital that will take place in March 2023.
​fee: £5 per piece to enter.

Cross-Generational Architecture Call
FuturArc Journal is calling for proposals, for 2023 to its annual architecture competition, open to professionals and students.
FuturArc Prize (FAP) 2023: Cross-Generational Architecture asks: How can we respond to societal issues for tomorrow’s generations amidst ongoing climate and planet challenges?
The way our built environments are designed should keep pace or even foresee changes in societal compositions. Whether countries are facing decreasing birth rates and mortality rates, can we still afford to design in ‘silos’?
Participants are invited to pick a site in Asia up to 5 hectares. Analyse the population census of their selected site at the macro and local levels. Investigate issues faced by the age groups in the area, supported by real-world data. Decide on a new mixed-use architectural intervention that could respond to the challenges identified (no single-function schools; community centres; libraries; parks; resorts; or hotels).
The competition is open internationally to individual or team entries.
Each team may comprise up to five members and may be from different related disciplines or a mix of students and professionals. The solo entrant or team leader must have an architecture background (student, graduate or professional).
Panels must be submitted in English.
The judging criteria include:
Relevance
Integration
Impact
Innovation
Please note that proposals must be supported by relevant real-world data and analysis. Extra credits will be awarded for the use of local resources, materials and manpower, and/or making space for non-human species (flora and fauna).
All winners will be awarded with the FuturArc Prize Trophy and the following cash prizes.
1st Place: Cash prize of SGD8,000 plus 2-year subscription to FuturArc app
2nd Place: Cash prize of SGD3,500 plus 1-year subscription to FuturArc app
3rd Place: Cash prize of SGD2,000 plus 1-year subscription to FuturArc app
Merits (up to 12 citations will be given): SGD500 each plus 1-year subscription to FuturArc app
FuturArc Prize is Asia’s first and leading Green design competition since 2007.
deadline: 15 February 2023

Open Call for Digital Diasporas
about : yáo collaborative maps and weaves the local and global constellations of artists, collectives, culture workers and stewards whose work opens portals for cross-border artistic exchange, friendship, and care between mainland China/HK and the rest of the world.
In 2021 we launched the first iteration of the Digital Diasporas, a distributed, remote residency which gave artists the space to research, cultivate their practice, and convene across borders. Last year’s residents Tian Zhang, Amy Lam, and Casey Tang inspired many generative conversations and long-lasting connections about colonialisms in multiple contexts, sustainability and equity in arts practices, and all the ways in which we (human, non-human, and ecological) coexist in all our relations.
Digital Diasporas was a spacious opportunity for artists to do deep thinking and form cross-border connections without the pressure of producing a final product. This year, we are excited to bring back this open call for a second iteration with an additional residency host in the United States.
–
Everyone is encouraged to apply, especially if you have never applied to anything in the past. We are particularly interested in applications that resist and interrogate stereotypical or reactionary impulses, instead turning our gaze towards the difficult but necessary conversations, care, and solidarities we might build across borders.
Digital Diasporas will host:
• one person or collective who self-identifies as Chinese and/or Sino diaspora in or from Australia (citizen or permanent resident)
• one person or collective who self-identifies as Chinese and/or Sino diaspora in or from Canada (citizen or permanent resident)
• one person or collective who self-identifies as Chinese and/or Sino, regardless of what passport they hold or where they reside
Offered by the residency:
The remote, six-week-long online residency will be facilitated by three host organizations in May and June. Each resident or collective will primarily work with one host organization in Canada, Australia, or the United States and all residents as a cohort will be in dialogue with one another through convenings. Each resident or collective will be awarded an unrestricted stipend of AUD $10,000 for their participation. Each host organization will design a program of remote/online mentoring, networking, research and development for the resident they host. The host organizations are:
• 4A Centre for Contemporary Asian Art (Sydney, Australia / the ancestral lands of the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation)
• Gendai (Toronto, Canada / the ancestral territory of many nations including the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishnabeg, the Chippewa, the Haudenosaunee and the Wendat peoples and now home to many diverse First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples)
• Asian Arts Initiative (Philadelphia, USA / ancestral homelands of the Lenape peoples)

Open Call for Site-Specific Projects
The 5th Little Islands Festival, starting from Sikinos (Greece), invites new media and performing arts artists to submit proposals that engage with ecology, anthropology, and science in the enduring dialogue about the relationship between humanity and nature. The island frontier, which like life itself emerges from the liquid element, becomes the principal space for exploring modern contradictions of human geography through art.
This next edition of Litltle Islands Festival will take place for 4-6 days between mid-July and mid-August of 2023. The organisers are calling for:
Site-specific projects that explore cultural heritage in relation to the natural environment of Sikinos and the Cyclades in general: windmills, threshing floors, rural dwellings, dry stone walls, terraces, sacred and archaeological sites.
Works inspired by traditions, rituals, myths, customs in conversation with nature. Works that explore movements and directions such as: Environmental Sociology, Eco-anarchism, Ecofeminism, Eco-communalism, Deep Ecology.
Artistic practices with an emphasis on participation.
Artistic workshops for children and adults on environmental awareness.
The festival is also opening applications for the LIF Residency and Research Programme 2023 in which participants will be hosted in Sikinos to create works inspired by the natural and cultural landscape of the island.
Applications are open to artists from Greece and abroad, art groups, young creatives, performers, filmmakers, musicians, dancers, architects, thinkers, activists, scientists, technologists, curators, educators and other creatives working in the field of hybrid arts/practices.
For participants in the live performance (live acts) and workshop categories the festival offers:
Airfare costs up to 200 euros per person.
Accommodation costs.
Ferry ticket costs.
Coverage of technical equipment.
Participants in the LIF Residency 2023 programme (1-2 weeks duration) will receive:
Ferry ticket costs.
Accommodation costs.
Food supplies.
Assistance and general guidance on project set-up.

Call for On-site Installation Artworks in the Roumare Forest
Métropole Rouen Normandie (France) is teaming up with ONF to host the Forêt Monumentale exhibition. This event is a two-year art exhibition that takes the form of a trail of monumental artworks, to be created in the Roumare Forest.
This unique trail of several kilometres offers visitors an opportunity to visit this remarkable natural habitat, or to see it from a different angle. It invites them to explore a stretch of woodland dotted with pieces created by plastic artists, landscapers, artists, designers and architects who have plunged themselves into these green lungs to experiment with new art forms.
The second Forêt Monumentale exhibition will open in June 2024 in the Roumare forest in Canteleu, near Rouen. It will end in 2026.
This call for creations will select a total of 9 artworks for installation in the forest along a 4-kilometre trail at various sites. A first phase will see around 20 candidates selected for a grant of 2000 EUR to elaborate their proposals. The final 9 projects will then be chosen to each receive 25,000 EUR to produce and then install their artwork between November 2023 – June 2024.
This call for creations is open to professionals and students of all creative disciplines: French and international artists, designers, architects, landscapers, performers, plastic artists, graphic designers, etc. Participants may be individuals or groups.
deadline: 27 February 2023

The Adolph and Esther Gottlieb Emergency Grant program is intended to provide interim financial assistance to qualified painters, printmakers, and sculptors whose needs are the result of an unforeseen, catastrophic incident, and who lack the resources to meet that situation. Each grant is given as one-time assistance for a specific emergency, examples of which are fire, flood, or emergency medical need.
This program has no deadlines.
The program does not consider requests for dental work, chronic situations, capital improvements, or projects of any kind; nor can it consider situations resulting from general indebtedness or lack of employment.
The maximum amount of this grant is $15,000; an award of $5,000 is typical.
Applicants should be aware that this is a grant program, and that each application is considered on its merits within the criteria of the program. While we attempt to provide assistance to as many applicants as we can, the filing of an application is not, nor should it be perceived as, a guarantee of funding.
ELIGIBILITY
To be eligible for this program, an artist must be able to demonstrate a minimum involvement of ten years in a mature phase of his or her work. Artists must work in the disciplines of painting, sculpture or printmaking. Each application will be reviewed by the Directors, who will exercise their discretion in considering it, and will determine the amount of each award. Applicants should note there is a set amount appropriated for these grants each fiscal year; once this budgetary limit has been reached, the Foundation will not be able to judge any additional requests on their merits.
Second-party requests are honored only when the applicant is physically unable to communicate with the Foundation. Review procedures for completed applications begin as soon as they are received. Full review generally takes about four weeks from the time an application is complete. Situations with imminent deadlines will receive priority.
The Foundation’s grant programs are open to both US based and international artists. US citizenship or residency is not required.

Mobility Support
TelepART Mobility Support promotes opportunities for performing artists, scientists and researchers to travel and perform internationally. It is an easy and quick micro-funding format aimed for emerging and semi-established professional artists and young academics.
There are two different types of grants within TelepART Mobility Support, TelepART-taide and TelepART-tiede. TelepART-taide can be applied for performing art projects and TelepART-tiede can be applied for research events.
The grant is intended for travel and accommodation costs up to €1,000 and the funding decision is made within two weeks from the application.
Run by the Finnish Cultural and Research Institutes, the platform hopes to generate more cultural and academic exchange opportunities between Finland and the following countries and regions (in both directions):
TelepART-taide
Argentina
Austria
Belgium
Brazil
Chile
Colombia
Croatia
Cuba
Czechia
Estonia
France
Germany
Greece

United Kingdom

TelepART-tiede

The platform is permanently open to applications, which can be submitted by individual academics or performers; groups; representatives of performers, such as agencies; or event organisers. Applicants will be notified of the decision within two weeks of submitting the application.
Funding may be granted for travel, accommodation and shipping costs. Starting from €100, the support is limited to a maximum of €1,000.
The grant must not represent more than 50% of the total cost of the production. Total production costs include travel, accommodation and shipping costs, performance fees and other performance related non-fixed costs (i.e. the technical staff for the performance), all including VAT. This rule assures that the travel budget is in balance with the size of the event.
If applying for the art grant, The Performer must receive a reasonable compensation for their work (“performance fee”).
Daily allowances, meals, etc. are neither supported by the programme nor included in the “Total costs of the production”.
The funding is granted at the discretion of the Finnish Cultural and Research Institutes, in consultation with varying performing arts professionals. Funded projects are published on the website of the relevant institute.
