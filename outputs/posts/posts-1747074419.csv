Local concerns will be highlighted through dialogues between engaged theorists, researchers, arts practitioners and educators. Public talks will take place each morning, to be followed by closed workshop sessions made up of small, themed working groups.
The project is a cross-disciplinary collaboration between Kinshasa (l’Académie des Beaux Arts, Democratic Republic of the Congo), Johannesburg (Wits School of Arts, University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa) and São Paulo (Universidade Federal de São Paulo, Brazil).
Project Concept & Format:
The workshop revolves around 2 main axis of (i) the relationships between historical narratives and artworks, alongside (ii) South-South dialogues in arts education. Comparative, cross-disciplinary methodologies and mutual points of destabilisation will be drawn out. Public sessions with 2 or 3 main speakers and respondants will take place each morning.
Afternoon sessions will take the form of focus groups of 5/6 people who will work together in the afternoons (the locations of these will be announced at the open morning sessions for members of students public that wish to join). Each group will consist of 2/3 visitors interacting with local partipants. Artist presentations & film screenings will be integrated throughout the event. Working groups will include feedback sessions from artist-educators (Ayrson Heráclito, BR; Natasha Christopher & Donna Kukama, SA) who will conduct student projects at ABA in the week of 11 – 15thJanuary, 2016, prior to the main event. The outcome of these sessions with artists and students will be displayed in the Institut Francais de Kinshasa’s Halle de la Gombe gallery space.
Suggested central themes around which the focus groups will be clustered:
•Education / pedagogy from the South
•Imaging Violence
•Exhibition histories
•The art institution and decolonization
•Comparative Methodologies
•Artworks as History

Seeing here implies Schauen (as in Weltanschauung) and is coupled with fantasy, with imagination.” Josef Albers, Interaction of Color
Thread accepts applications from artists and writers of any medium or style. Residencies will last at least 4 weeks with the specific duration determined on a case-by-case basis. There will be two artists in residence at a time.
Applications are accepted on a rolling basis.
Thread covers the following expenses for all resident artists:
–
Food and Board
–
All travel within Senegal (from arrival to departure).
–
A modest materials budget (further funding can be discussed with the Director)
Travel to Senegal can be arranged with the help of Thread’s team. Whether this means our sponsorship of travel grants, or other third-party funding.
It has always been our belief that the residency should be available to artists of any medium, and any attitude towards the role that art can or should play in people’s lives. People often assume that all artists coming to Thread will have a highly specific project in mind that involves the community there. This is not the case. The residency is a sponsorship of artists to spend time in Sinthian, not to create a certain kind of project or have a certain kind of impact. That said, we believe it is necessary for all residents to have a desire to engage in some way with the Sinthian community, whether that be through their artwork, their workshops, or a form of exchange we haven’t thought of. There are ongoing workshops at Thread that artists will feel free to engage in, and our General Manager is on hand to help execute any workshops or projects designed by visiting artists that involve the Sinthian community.
Contexts and Conditions
Those applying should be aware that French and Pulaar (along with a few other West African dialects) are spoken in Sinthian. While Moussa Sene, who will be available at most times, is fluent in English, very few other Sinthian residents speak English. See below for our view on language proficiency.
Applicants should also be aware of the climate in Sinthian. The months of residency during Sinthian’s dry season (November – May), depending on the time of year, temperatures can get very high (near to 115° Fahrenheit). It is a dry heat, but it is certainly very hot. In the rainy season (July – October), it rains tumultuously but briefly most days, riveting to behold but a challenge too.
Finally, Sinthian is a remote village. If arriving in Dakar, artists will be driven the seven hours to the Tambacounda region and to Sinthian, which is one hour from the nearest city. This isolation is one of the great luxuries of Thread, and while residents will have the opportunity to go to town for supplies, cell phone service, and internet whenever they need to, Thread is not the residency for those that need to stay “in-touch” at all times.
For this reason, please provide a brief statement about whether the language barrier, heat, or remoteness will be an issue for you, or any plans you may have to ameliorate these conditions.
Facility
Each residence contains a bedroom, bathroom, kitchenette, and private indoor studio space. This is in addition to outdoor studio space, and the main, public area of the building.
There is plumbing and electricity in each residence, though these utilities should be used modestly. The building is designed using local techniques to create airflow and natural air conditioning.
The studios are blank spaces upon artists’ arrival, though some materials or furniture may be provided on a case by case basis.
Applicant Criteria
This residency enables artists to spend time in Sinthian for reasons of their own choosing, in regard both to their own work and their engagement with the local community. We are looking above all for enthusiastic artists open to new ideas and perspectives; they need not have a highly specific project in mind that involves the community there. Time at Thread is available to artists of any medium, nationality, or ethnicity, with far-ranging attitudes towards the role that art can or should play in the world. The primary requisite, rather, is the openness implicit in Josef Albers’s statement above where Albers specifies that “Schauen” (to see) is the specific seeing that incorporates a deep consideration of the world;” “Weltanschauung” or “world view”.
We have left the programming of Thread open so that it can be adapted to needs as they arise. We want the people of Sinthian to be in control of how their cultural center functions, and greatly look forward to collaborating with them on adjusting the artistic program so that it palpably enhances their lives.
A note on Language
When considering whether French language proficiency or knowledge of local African tongues should be a requirement for artists, we recalled that when Josef Albers was invited to and arrived at Black Mountain College in 1933, he did not yet speak English. He nonetheless managed to revolutionize art education in America and worldwide. A willingness to expand one’s personal frontiers in possibly daunting circumstances helped infuse both of the Alberses’ work with its vitality and strength. Willpower and energy, more than a mastery of the local tongue, are what counts for great artists to advance in their own work and have an impact on others.
APPLICATION
Applications are accepted on a rolling basis. Currently, the first available residencies begin in February, 2016
Please provide:
•Approximately 10 images (or 3 videos) of your work, including most recent work.
•Resume
•Artist Statement
•Statement of Intention (your plans for potential projects or pieces, objectives during the residency, and/or expectations for your relationship to the Sinthian community while there)
•Desired dates for residency
•Two references, and/or statement on relevant previous endeavors
•Link to website, if applicable

See below for our view on language proficiency.</p><p class=p3>Applicants should also be aware of the climate in Sinthian. The months of residency during Sinthian’s dry season (November – May), depending on the time of year, temperatures can get very high (near to 115° Fahrenheit). It is a dry heat, but it is certainly very hot. In the rainy season (July – October), it rains tumultuously but briefly most days, riveting to behold but a challenge too.</p><p class=p3>Finally, Sinthian is a remote village. If arriving in Dakar, artists will be driven the seven hours to the Tambacounda region and to Sinthian, which is one hour from the nearest city. This isolation is one of the great luxuries of Thread, and while residents will have the opportunity to go to town for supplies, cell phone service, and internet whenever they need to, Thread is not the residency for those that need to stay “in-touch” at all times.</p><p class=p3>For this reason, please provide a brief statement about whether the language barrier, heat, or remoteness will be an issue for you, or any plans you may have to ameliorate these conditions.</p><p class=p2><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Facility</span></p><p class=p3>Each residence contains a bedroom, bathroom, kitchenette, and private indoor studio space. This is in addition to outdoor studio space, and the main, public area of the building.</p><p class=p3>There is plumbing and electricity in each residence, though these utilities should be used modestly. The building is designed using local techniques to create airflow and natural air conditioning.</p><p class=p3>The studios are blank spaces upon artists’ arrival, though some materials or furniture may be provided on a case by case basis.</p><p class=p2><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Applicant Criteria</span></p><p class=p3>This residency enables artists to spend time in Sinthian for reasons of their own choosing, in regard both to their own work and their engagement with the local community. We are looking above all for enthusiastic artists open to new ideas and perspectives; they need not have a highly specific project in mind that involves the community there. Time at Thread is available to artists of any medium, nationality, or ethnicity, with far-ranging attitudes towards the role that art can or should play in the world. The primary requisite, rather, is the openness implicit in Josef Albers’s statement above where Albers specifies that “Schauen” (to see) is the specific seeing that incorporates a deep consideration of the world;” “Weltanschauung” or “world view”.</p><p class=p3>We have left the programming of Thread open so that it can be adapted to needs as they arise. We want the people of Sinthian to be in control of how their cultural center functions, and greatly look forward to collaborating with them on adjusting the artistic program so that it palpably enhances their lives.</p><p class=p3><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">A note on Language</span></p><p class=p3>When considering whether French language proficiency or knowledge of local African tongues should be a requirement for artists, we recalled that when Josef Albers was invited to and arrived at Black Mountain College in 1933, he did not yet speak English. He nonetheless managed to revolutionize art education in America and worldwide. A willingness to expand one’s personal frontiers in possibly daunting circumstances helped infuse both of the Alberses’ work with its vitality and strength. Willpower and energy, more than a mastery of the local tongue, are what counts for great artists to advance in their own work and have an impact on others.</p><p class=p2><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">APPLICATION</span></p><p class=p3>Applications are accepted on a rolling basis. Currently, the first available residencies begin in February, 2016</p><p class=p3>Please provide:</p><p class=p3>•Approximately 10 images (or 3 videos) of your work, including most recent work.</p><p class=p3>•Resume</p><p class=p3>•Artist Statement</p><p class=p3>•Statement of Intention (your plans for potential projects or pieces, objectives during the residency, and/or expectations for your relationship to the Sinthian community while there)</p><p class=p3>•Desired dates for residency</p><p class=p3>•Two references, and/or statement on relevant previous endeavors</p><p class=p3>•Link to website, if applicable</p><p class=p2>ALL APPLICATIONS AND QUESTIONS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED TO THREAD’S DIRECTOR, NICK MURPHY, AT NMURPHY@ALBERSFOUNDATION.ORG</p><p class=p2><a href=http://www.thread-senegal.org/apply/ target=_blank>thread-senegal.org/apply/</a></p><p class=p3></p><p> </p></div>"

How could something you do not know touch you? What effect(s) can knowledges evoke when they appear invisible to you? Where to start to transform failure into creative force(s), in connection with mixed and forgotten ancestries?
The workshop takes Pêdra Costa’s Southern Butthole Manifesto as point of departure to critically address how the colonial project promotes annihilation and extinction of knowledge. In the workshop, Pêdra Costa will elaborate on ‘Invisible Knowledge’ used in the performance on February 4, 2019, and comes back to artistic strategies including post-porn aesthetics, queer politics and the methodology of the crossroads, through hers own body. The aim is to both convey and confuse the usage of such strategies vis-à-vis the participants, while situating them in the context of Macumba, in back and forth motions from Pêdra Costa’s day-to-day queer life experiences of decolonial resistances from Brazil to Western Europe.
The methodology of the crossroads, which informs hers practice will be shared to alleviate opposition, and to enable empowerment of marginalized communities. Pêdra Costa asks, how the colonial break-down could conjure non-westernized knowledge (i.e., the epistemicide). The workshop critically questions the base of western knowledge-making inherent in Eurocentric traditions. It also reflects on individual responsibility in holding on to such specific systems of knowledge production and circulation, which are partly responsible for the repetition and reproduction of violence. If the performance de_colon_isation part V is to reveal individual privileges and daily behaviours towards violence, the workshop shall equally be a possibility to create an in-depth and critical address about how knowledge is embodied on and via academic agendas – what are their prevalent structures? And what kind of expectations do normalized regimes of knowledge cause? Who can claim the recognition of knowledge as such? Whose voices are to be heard and listened to (and whose are not)? How to embody knowledges?
Furthermore, the artist will provide performative and discursive tools to ‘exorcise the individualistic self’ and to rethink identity politics in the lines of non-binary relations of radical caring. Showing some videos, Pêdra Costa will introduce hers decolonial strategies as pedagogical approach. She will share hers spiritual heritage of the Macumba, as potential creative force(s) of self-empowerment. Acknowledging that invisible knowledge consists of a process of remembering the forgotten and almost-destroyed knowledges, also in Europe, the artist presents this remembrance as a means to mobilize creative and reparative impulses to spin pain into powerful transformation. Along these lines, the workshop invites each and everyone to share and reflect on the creative power of their own knowledges.
Please note: The workshop takes place one day after Pêdra Costa’s performance de_colon_isation part IV: a performative experience, the last event in the Lecture Series “Violence in the Arts”, which will take place on Monday, 04.02.2019 at the Medienhaus (Aula, Grunewaldstr. 2–5, 10823 Berlin) from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. This event does not require registration.

It also reflects on individual responsibility in holding on to such specific systems of knowledge production and circulation, which are partly responsible for the repetition and reproduction of violence. If the performance de_colon_isation part V is to reveal individual privileges and daily behaviours towards violence, the workshop shall equally be a possibility to create an in-depth and critical address about how knowledge is embodied on and via academic agendas – what are their prevalent structures? And what kind of expectations do normalized regimes of knowledge cause? Who can claim the recognition of knowledge as such? Whose voices are to be heard and listened to (and whose are not)? How to embody knowledges?</p><p>Furthermore, the artist will provide performative and discursive tools to ‘exorcise the individualistic self’ and to rethink identity politics in the lines of non-binary relations of radical caring. Showing some videos, Pêdra Costa will introduce hers decolonial strategies as pedagogical approach. She will share hers spiritual heritage of the Macumba, as potential creative force(s) of self-empowerment. Acknowledging that invisible knowledge consists of a process of remembering the forgotten and almost-destroyed knowledges, also in Europe, the artist presents this remembrance as a means to mobilize creative and reparative impulses to spin pain into powerful transformation. Along these lines, the workshop invites each and everyone to share and reflect on the creative power of their own knowledges.</p><p><strong>Please note: The workshop takes place one day after Pêdra Costa’s performance de_colon_isation part IV: a performative experience, the last event in the Lecture Series “Violence in the Arts”, which will take place on Monday, 04.02.2019 at the Medienhaus (Aula, Grunewaldstr. 2–5, 10823 Berlin) from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. This event does not require registration.</strong></p><p>Pêdra Costa about the de_colon_isation performance series:</p><div class=""BorlabsCookie _brlbs-cb-vimeo""><div class=_brlbs-content-blocker><div class=""_brlbs-embed _brlbs-video-vimeo""> <img decoding=async class=_brlbs-thumbnail src=https://contemporaryand.com/wp-content/plugins/borlabs-cookie/assets/images/cb-no-thumbnail.png alt=Vimeo><div class=_brlbs-caption><p>By loading the video, you agree to Vimeos’s privacy policy.<br><iframe src=http://player.vimeo.com/video/https://vimeo.com/privacy width=534 height=400 frameborder=0 webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p><a class=""_brlbs-btn _brlbs-icon-play-white"" href=# data-borlabs-cookie-unblock role=button>Load video</a></p><p><label><input type=checkbox name=unblockAll value=1 checked> <small>Always unblock Vimeo</small></label></p></div></div></div><div class=borlabs-hide data-borlabs-cookie-type=content-blocker data-borlabs-cookie-id=vimeo><script type=text/template>PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0iX2JybGJzLWZsdWlkLXdpZHRoLXZpZGVvLXdyYXBwZXIiPjxpZnJhbWUgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL3BsYXllci52aW1lby5jb20vdmlkZW8vMjI4MjA3NDA5P2FwcF9pZD0xMjI5NjMiIHdpZHRoPSI1MDAiIGhlaWdodD0iMjgxIiBmcmFtZWJvcmRlcj0iMCIgdGl0bGU9IlAmZWNpcmM7ZHJhIENvc3RhIC0gV0VMVCBLT01QQUtUPyIgYWxsb3c9ImF1dG9wbGF5OyBmdWxsc2NyZWVuIiBhbGxvd2Z1bGxzY3JlZW4+PC9pZnJhbWU+PC9kaXY+</script></div></div><p>Pêdra Costa is a Brazilian Performance Artist and Anthropologist based between Vienna and Berlin and working with queer artists internationally.

In addition to this high rate, Malian women are further violated by an unspoken cultural norm called sutura, a tradition that psychologically grooms women and girls to conceal, forgive, and bear their sufferings in order to avoid a culturally-construed sense of shame.
Renowned Malian performing artist, Fatoumata Bagayoko, has designed a dance performance workshop titled Musow Kumkan (Women’s Voice) for Musow Ka Touma Sera, an exhibition of six Malian photographers whose work examines the tradition of sutura. The workshop seeks to provide a safe space to share thoughts on sexual violence and encourages participants to speak out and understand the impact of words on individual actions and the collective achievement. Spoken words will be translated into a series of individual movements and a final group choreography. The workshop aims to help participants find a renewed sense of self-confidence through voice and body.
Everyone is welcome to participate. Please dress comfortably. Refreshments will be provided, but bring your own water as a reserve.
The performance will be accompanied by a live band with traditional Malian instruments.
Like many children, Fatoumata Bagayoko danced for traditional ceremonies in her neighborhood. While originally she pursued a technical degree in electricity, her desire for an artistic career eventually took her to the National Institute of Arts in Bamako. After graduating, she entered the Balla Fasseke Kouyate Conservatory of Arts and Multimedia in Bamako, and obtained a 5-year program diploma with a specialty in dance. During this time, she received training in traditional dance with Karim Togola and Kardjigue Laico Traore as well as with internationally recognized dancers and choreographers: Opiyo Okach, Pierre Doussaint, Serge Aime Coulibaly, Reggie Wilson, Gregory Maqoma, Herman Diephuis, to name a few. Bagayoko’s solo Fatou t’as tout fait (Fatou tried it all) was first presented at the festival Dense Bamako Danse in November 2015 where she received 1st Prize from the Foundation Orange, Mali. The piece also won 1st prize at the Bobo Dialasso competition Simply the Best Africa, 2016 (Ankata/Serge-Aime Coulibaly) and the ZBK Acknowledgment Prize 2017 at Zurcher Theater Spektakel in Zurich. Bagayoko heads a dance company called Jiriladon and in addition to her choreographic work, she has been teaching dance to the girls in her neighborhood for several years. She also leads the project Kene Koura (New Space) dedicated to teaching dance to girls. In life and in her work, Fatoumata brings her art to protest violence against women.

The digital Young Curators Academy is an artistic and activist platform to discover alliances, research affinities, and consolidate solidarities. Intersectional makers—artists, thinkers, writers, curators—take part in the Academy’s workshops and develop personal strategies to activate their communities. The focus will fall on care and repair, planetary consciousness, and the search for new forms of international cooperation and joint artistic practice. The program is aimed at those who enable new lines of flight across patriarchal and geopolitical boundaries. In 2021, the digital YCA will also respond to the world after the intervention by the pandemic. How does the absence of presence change resistance, activism, art, and communication?

The New (Old) World in 10 Acts
Arts and activism begin from gatherings of humans coming together to celebrate, to grieve, to discuss. These fundamental human acts communicate in different ways but most of all, they are small actions of personal agency contributing to a desired or needed transformation in the world of the living. Since we crashed into the iceberg of the pandemic, our worlds have been incessantly talking about the new normal. How will this new normal affect arts and activism in particular? In the face of restrictions to physical international travel, how does this affect curation as well as activation of communities during gatherings in arts and activism? How can there be shifts to local curation, to open it up as a comparative study of other local contexts? Can digitalization and some of its processes enrich this interweaving discourse between the new international and the new local?
With Soukaina Aboulaoula, Mona Benyamin, Martha Luisa Hernández Cadenas, Helia Hamedani, Adela Jusic, Vinhay Keo, Rola Khayyat, Olivia Hyunsin Kim, Donna Miranda, Amila Puzić, Promona Sengupta, Aziz Sohail, Claudia Zini

The Super Intense Marathon
In the tradition of the Young Curators Academy (YCA), we gather for the kickoff marathon presented by all the participants of the D-YCA 2021. Rigorously selected from an open call conducted in April–June, these participants will share their practices with translocal audiences around the world, on the new digital platform specially created this year. For the first time, the YCA marathon will be digitized, resulting in different publics in different time zones around the world accessing different knowledges, reflecting and deepening their own practices from parallel experiences. Without privileging a physical site in one city, the digital realm of D-YCA 2021 hopes to nurture translocal public debates, focus “situated” artistic conversations, and act as an amplifier for intensities of resistance.
With Anajara Amarante, Tara Al-Dughaither, Aouefa Amoussouvi, Kat Benedict, Karon Sabrina Corrales, Niyati Dave, Flupsi, Blerta Hocia, Giuliana Kiersz, Yu-Chin Ku, Sumac Space, Davood Madadpoor, Darya Aloufy, Shaunak Mahbubani, James Notin (Richard Kayode O), Ozhopé Collective, Pingkan Polla, Bea Rubio-Gabriel, Nirlyn Seijas, Kira Smyreva, June Yuen Ting, Andrei Zavalei

The Digital Agora
If one understands the creation of commons as a social practice for the formulation of alternative forms of knowledge production and knowledge exchange, in order to challenge accessibility and ownership, we are inside the heart of The Digital Agora.
The Digital Agora is based on the ancient Greek Agora. It is a digital public space which is a gathering place for politics, open studios online and workshops, a market of competing ideas, a place of assembly to hear statements of scientists and artists, different perspectives of activists negotiating different publics, a recharge zone for the body and the spirit, essentially a digital site to hang out.
Directed by Ong Keng Sen

Curatorial support: Anne Diestelkamp

This year, the RAW Academy Session 11 will be led by Felwine Sarr, writer and Professor of Romance Studies at Duke University. It will run from June 2 to July 4, 2025.
What is RAW Académie
RAW Académie is an experimental residential program for the study and research of artistic and curatorial practice and thought. The program usually takes place over five to seven weeks in Dakar. It is dedicated to dynamic reflection on artistic research, curatorial practice, and critical writing. The Academie runs for 1 session per year; May-June or October-November. Session 11 will be led by Felwine Sarr, writer and Professor of Romance Studies at Duke University. It will run from June 2 to July 4, 2025.
A Sense of Place/Displacement, Replacement, Non-placement
RAW Académie Session 11 builds on the compelling reflections initiated during Condition Report 5: A Sense of Place/Displacement, Replacement, Non-placement, an international symposium developed in collaboration with Prof. Felwine Sarr. The symposium explored how places embody histories, connections, and energies that are often invisible but deeply felt. It asked how such presences can be nurtured, sustained, and transformed in a world increasingly marked by displacement and environmental, social, and political upheaval.
This session of the Academie provides an important opportunity to further develop these questions through a series of seminars and to critically engage with the complex relationship between people and the places they inhabit, exploring how identity, memory, and creativity intersect with the material and immaterial dimensions of place.
Central to this endeavor is the need to rethink the fundamental rights of belonging and access in a world marked by displacement and exclusion. Hospitality, often understood as a gesture of inclusion, here transcends its conventional meanings to become an ethical and philosophical imperative – a lens through which we interrogate borders, identity, and the politics of presence.
These reflections naturally extend to the urban context, where cities like Dakar serve as both archives of memory and laboratories of transformation. Urban environments shape and are shaped by the people who inhabit them. As sites of cultural transmission and community resilience, cities offer fertile ground for examining how collective memory and adaptive strategies can coexist with the demands of modernisation and sustainability.
The session also addresses the transformative potential of place-based education. By embracing learning practices grounded in local ecosystems, histories, and communities, it seeks to dismantle hierarchical knowledge systems. This approach strengthens Indigenous practices and relational ways of knowing, emphasising the interconnectedness of people and their environments.
At a time when the global climate crisis looms large, the question of how we live in shared environments takes on new urgency. This seminar examines how human and non-human life can coexist in balance, exploring community-led ecological practices that prioritise sustainability and justice. Rather than focusing on the overwhelming consequences of environmental degradation, the focus will be on examples of care and stewardship that respect biodiversity and resist extractivist logics.
Finally, it invites reflection on the invisible threads that weave the essence of place. These intangible connections – embodied in collective memory, oral traditions, and spiritual practices – anchor communities in their histories while providing tools for resilience..
The curriculum of the session will be shaped weekly by an exceptional group of visiting faculty whose research and practice span a range of disciplines and offer rich insights into how these issues intersect with history, culture, and social practice. It will include anthropologist and historian Abdourahmane Seck; architect and anthropologist Sénamé Koffi Agbodjinou; historian and exhibition maker Samia Henni; interdisciplinary historian, activist and social and political organiser Dr Sónia Vaz Borges (To be confirmed); researcher, designer and architectural educator Mae-ling Lokko; and finally Alibeta, musician, curator & founder of Kenu – Lab’Oratoire des Imaginaires.

With buoyant sales reported across the board, New York’s most established fair for modern and contemporary art returned to Piers 92 & 94 from March 5 to 8, 2015 to present works by over 1,500 artists from 199 galleries across the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia.

Now one of the pre-eminent international centres of the contemporary art world, Basel and the surrounding region function as a dynamic nexus of people, ideas and work, which at the same time has a creative life outside of the major contemporary art events that are convened annually. In 2016, this residency will target the Southern African region, and the call will be managed through the Johannesburg office of Pro Helvetia.
Call for applications
The call for applications is open to (freelance) curators, art mediators and art critics from Southern Africa who are interested in immersing themselves in the Swiss art scene, doing some deeper research about art in the heart of Europe and establishing a show which includes regional and Swiss artists, in collaboration with the team of “Ausstellungsraum Klingental”. Applicants can be from any of the following countries in the Southern African region:
Angola, Botswana, Democratic Republic of Congo, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Seychelles, Tanzania (including Zanzibar), Zambia, and Zimbabwe.
Submissions should reach Pro Helvetia Johannesburg by August 1 2015.
What we expect
For art space “Ausstellungsraum Klingental” the main goal of the curator’s exchange programme is to build more knowledge about the philosophy and practice of curating in other countries and contexts. We are interested in a critical view from the outside of our local art scene; for a curator to articulate his/her perception and position on our way of “doing art”. “Ausstellungsraum Klingental” offers the curator from Southern Africa the opportunity to realise an exhibition or event as part of the annual “Regionale” – this is a big exhibition featuring local artists and taking place in/around 16 venues in the tri-national region of Basel (Switzerland), Alsace (France) and Südbaden (Southern Germany).
We expect from the applicant:
?An open mind; a willingness to network and cooperate with different people from the regional and more broadly Swiss art scene
?An interest in the Basel and wider Swiss art scene as a context for creative work and inquiry
?Commitment to set up a show or a project/event at “Ausstellungsraum Klingental” in late November 2016
?A willingness to re-invest the Swiss/Basel network into a project or projects in Southern Africa after coming back
?A basic fluency in written and spoken English is essential
To apply please submit:
?CV
?A letter of motivation
?A preliminary outline/abstract of your research/project/exhibition at “Ausstellungsraum Klingental”, ideally including some preliminary consideration of lines of inquiry that you would want to pursue through the residency, as well as any artists/networks you would specifically want to engage with.
?A rough budget, indicating in a very preliminary way how you might deploy the CHF 5000 production budget for the exhibition
What we provide to the incoming curator:
?Accommodation in one of the Atelier Mondial Studios
?Living and travelling costs: CHF 12’000.- (5 months)
?Networking-dinner with curators from Basel in September 2016
?The opportunity to set up an exhibition or project/event at art space “Ausstellungsraum Klingental” in November 2016 (during the “Regionale”), with the support of local volunteers
?A contribution to exhibition costs up to maximum CHF 5’000.- plus provision of technical equipment, invitation cards and other support for the promotion of the event
?a motivated, active and curious host team with a lot of connections and experience in non-institutional artistic initiatives
Submissions should be mailed to johannesburg@prohelvetia.org.za with “Klingental Residency: [your name]” in the subject line by August 1 2015.
Jury: The Johannesburg and Zurich offices of Pro Helvetia, the board of the “Ausstellungsraum Klingental” and the jury of Atelier Mondial will together determine the successful candidate.
For generations Ausstellunsgsraum Klingental has served as a platform to discuss and present visual art projects developped in the region of Basel. It presents four to five exhibitions every year, alongside a variety of spontaneous events, concerts and performances. The program is run by artists and art historians and feeds on the ideas and initiative of its many volunteer contributors who like to move with ambition, diligence and limited budgets.
Ausstellungsraum Klingental is focused more on experimental and artistic research than presenting established positions. It is a rather unique model of how to renew and sustain a city gallery on a high level. Guest curators can benefit from its widespread and hospitable networks. They will be invited to participate in Ausstellungsraum Klingental’s creative machinery /environment – which could be inspiring to all involved and inform the curators about the field where they will present their project towards the end of their residency.
Atelier Mondial is an International Arts Exchange Program which offers visual artists from the region of Basel, Southern Germany and Alsace (France) the opportunity to spend a number of months working abroad. Atelier Mondial has nine studios in the tri-national region of Basel and currently arranges exchanges with ten partner organizations abroad.

About Open School East
Open School East was founded in 2013 in response to spiralling tuition fees and student debt. It was instituted as a space for artistic learning and production that is experimental, versatile and highly collaborative.
Located in a former library and community centre in East London, OSE is a unique space that brings together:
– A free study programme for emerging artists;
– A multifaceted programme of events and activities open to all.
Central to OSE’s approach is a commitment to fostering cultural, intellectual and social exchanges between artists and the broader public. We do this by opening our study programme outwards, responding to our locality and providing an informal environment for the sharing of knowledge and skills across various communities—artistic, local and otherwise.
Study programme overview
Open School East is an innovative model of an artists’ study programme that engages socially and culturally with its local context.
We provide a unique environment for artist-led learning through:
– Shared studio provision;
– Tuition and mentorship from internationally renowned practitioners, curators and theorists;
– Support in the production of artistic projects.
The study programme is run according to principles of collaboration, experimentation and openness, and welcomes practitioners who engage with these notions in different ways.
How does the study programme function?
Free to attend and non-accredited, the study programme runs across 12 months and is principally self-directed, creating platforms for the associate artists to develop their practice.
The associates come together two days a week to receive tuition, meet the mentors, work and collaborate on projects, and plan public activities. Tuition is delivered through a combination of tutorials, group crits, presentations, workshops, seminars and excursions, a number of which are open to the public.
While at OSE, the associates are required to develop a specific project or line of enquiry. Their research is advanced and shared with the public via open studios and events taking place at different times throughout the year.
In lieu of paying fees, each associate gives the equivalent of one day every month to devise, run or assist with public events and activities in and around the building.
In 2016, the study programme will be structured around three moments:
Term 1: The associates participate in a collaborative research project initiated by Olivia Plender and culminating in a performance led by the artist. The project draws on the methods of the community arts movement, exploring its origins in the 1970s and its contemporary relevance. Together with Ed Webb-Ingall, Olivia Plender has devised a curriculum around models of collaboration, feminisms, the politics of the voice, the aesthetics and ethics of participation, and how we as artists can approach history.
Terms 2 and 3: The associates receive mentorship, self-direct their learning around their practices and shared interests, programme public events and develop their respective projects.
Term 4: the associates realise and present their project as part of a final collective event.
The mentors
The mentors for 2016 include Matthew Darbyshire, Sally O’Reilly and Ed Webb-Ingall, among others to be confirmed. The mentors come in at regular intervals to lead theoretical and practical group sessions, as well as provide one-to-one support in the development of the associates’ projects.
To find out more about the study programme, our requirements and the selection process, please visit: www.openschooleast.org
Open School East was originally commissioned by the Barbican and Create London. It has received further support from Arts Council England, Create London, Outset, The Ampersand Foundation, Hackney Council, The Sheepdrove Trust, individual donors, artists and galleries.

Art Dubai is known as a particularly innovative fair, and one that takes a truly global approach to today’s art world. The leading international fair in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia, Art Dubai places an emphasis on maintaining an intimate, human scale while foregrounding quality and diversity. Selected galleries range from world-renowned dealers to upcoming artspaces.
Art Dubai has a particularly close relationship with its galleries: the artists they represent, and the works they select, reconfirm year-on-year the fair’s role as a site of discovery and diversity.
Art Dubai 2015, the largest and most international edition to date, welcomed 92 participating galleries from 40 countries, 400 leading museum directors and institutional curators, and featured the work of more than 500 artists. Galleries reported healthy sales to local, regional and international collectors and institutions.
Art Dubai features three gallery programmes—Contemporary, Modern and Marker:
Galleries will be selected to participate in the largest of the fair’s gallery programmes, Art Dubai Contemporary, via a proposal and selection process. Artists presented in the Contemporary halls range from emerging and upcoming practitioners from lesser-known art capitals to household names. The works they present cover all artistic media—including painting, drawing, sculpture, installation, video, photography and performance.
Applications are accepted from galleries working in the primary market, established for at least two years, and will be reviewed by Art Dubai’s Selection Committee, comprised of gallerists and guest curators. The Committee discusses each application, basing their final selection on the submitted proposal, curatorial strength of the gallery exhibition programme and congruity with Art Dubai’s identity. Art Dubai is a global fair with its roots in the Middle East. The fair aims to foreground a gallery system that is rigorous and highly supportive of artists and innovative projects.
Art Dubai Modern is the only programme, worldwide, devoted to masters from the Middle East, Africa and South Asia, presented by regionally and internationally based galleries. Each exhibitor curates a solo or two-person show featuring works created up until the year 2000.
Galleries are invited to submit proposals now for booth exhibitions at Art Dubai Modern 2016, focusing on artists whose work has proven highly influential during the 20th century and on later generations of artists; galleries are encouraged to focus on a particular period or thematic within an artist’s practice.
Proposals are then reviewed by a curatorial committee, made up of renowned curators and historians with a particular interest in modernist practices of the Middle East, Africa and Asia.
Marker is a curated programme within the Contemporary halls, focusing each year on a particular theme or geography. By invitation only, the theme and curator for Marker 2016 will be announced shortly.
Application deadline: September 12, 2015
The application form is available here.
For further information, email Bettina Klein and Lea Chikhani from the exhibitions team.
Art Dubai is held in partnership with The Abraaj Group and is sponsored by Emaar and Julius Baer. Madinat Jumeirah is home to the event. Mashreq Private Banking is the exclusive partner of Art Dubai Modern.
The Dubai Culture and Arts Authority is a strategic partner of Art Dubai, and supports the fair’s year-round education programme.
Art Dubai’s extensive not-for-profit programme includes Art Dubai Projects; an exhibition of works by winners of the annual The Abraaj Group Art Prize; a range of educational programmes including The Sheikha Manal Little Artists Program and the community school Campus Art Dubai; and the critically acclaimed Global Art Forum.

The aim is to present reflections and critical contributions about Performance Art and Performativity in relations to history, narratives, body, presence, present, past and future.
EX NUNC welcome interdisciplinary approaches and any proposal that use written as well as visual contents, including video, audio and photographic forms.
A key starting point for this year’s theme, Historical Body, is the paradox that EX NUNC itself represents by presenting performance art practice through traces and records. According to many theorists Performance is, for its own nature, traceless and therefore ‘cannot be saved, recorded documented, or otherwise participate in the circulation of representations of representations’ [Phelan]. On the other hand History is based on what is left: memories, remembering, personal stories, influenced and distorted narratives, politics and neglected facts. The body is the site for private and collective memory construction, and it is from here that our research begins. Historical Body aims to think the body as an entity full of temporalities, a surface on which Past carves its traces, and Future casts its shadows.
Historical Body questions how a theory and practice of change and becoming might act in relation to the historical presence of personal and collective narratives. How the body conveys its temporalities, reflects the past and moves towards the future? We would like to reach out to external contributors in order to gather a relevant and meaningful amount of material that questions these issues.
Contributions can explore, but need not to be limited to, the following topics:
•Preservation of memories;
•Performing history;
•Construct narratives and rewriting the past;
•Storytelling urge;
•Historical readings of identity;
•Postcolonial narratives;
•Obliterated histories;
•Speculative futures;
•Practice of remembering and forgetting;
•Personal and intimate stories;
•Collective stories and World History;
SCHEDULE
Proposal deadline: Monday 21 September
Final draft deadline: Monday 12 October
GUIDELINES FOR SUBMISSIONS
•Proposal will be accepted by email only;
•Length of the proposal: 500 words max;
•Lenght of the final draft, for written contributions: 1500 words max;
For writings that are longer than 1500 words please contact us, we would be happy to discuss this further.
All proposals should be sent to info@ex-nunc.org. Please indicate in the subject line: JOURNAL PROPOSAL – HISTORICAL BODY I
EX NUNC is a curatorial and editorial project that aims to map, analyse and question the theory and practice of performance art and performativity. EX NUNC occupies both an on-line and off-line dimension; the former is represented by the website, which is structured as a polyhedral platform for presentation of meaningful material, the latter consists in a series of curatorial interventions taking place in different international locations. As a research-oriented project, EX NUNC intends to add a relevant contribution to the contemporary discourse about performance art. The on-line platform will focus each year on a specific subject-matter, which will be explored across the website’s three main sections: Curatorial, Journal and Atlas.

Deadline: September 30, 2015 at midnight
All artists interested in applying for a residency, solo or collaborative exhibitions with an up to date profile and active practitioners, are invited to submit exhibition proposals of their solo or collaborative work for the 2016 season.
1. Artists must submit proposals for the presentation of their own (solo or collaborative) work.
2. For collaborations, artists must confirm interest/availability before they submit the proposal.
3. Artists who have previously exhibited at the NGB in the past 3 years will not be eligible for the 2016 call, but can apply for 2017 onwards.
4. Artists are required to have an active and full 2016 membership to the NGB
Guidelines:
While we accept submissions based on all sorts of ideas, in 2016 we will be committed to
exhibiting:
1) The work of emerging and under-represented artists, particularly those in the region
2) Work that contributes to the ongoing dialogue about contemporary art practices.
3) Projects that push artistic practice in new and interesting directions.
4) Topics and styles not well represented by private or commercial spaces or otherwise difficult to show elsewhere.
5) The work of artists previously exhibited anywhere in Zimbabwe unless if it’s an itinerant exhibition.
6) Projects that take in account our limited gallery space. Thoughtful and orderly installations that respect the “breathing space” of each artwork tend to work better in our gallery.
Please take note: The above are just guidelines, so don’t worry if your exhibition/ project doesn’t satisfy everything listed; however, you must follow all rules.
How to Submit/ Format Requirements:
Before sending the application, please make sure to have the following prepared:
1. Application letter
2. Up to 10 images of your work. The images should ideally represent the actual work selected
for the exhibition. If this is impossible, the images should represent works that are
comparable to those that will be featured in the exhibition. These images should be JPGS,
no larger than 1024 x 768, 72dpi, preferably under 1MB.
They MUST be named in this format:
01YourFirstName_LastName.jpg
02YourFirstName_LastName.jpg
03YourFirstName_LastName.jpg
04YourFirstName_LastName.jpg
05YourFirstName_LastName.jpg
… etc.
2) Up to 3 videos (*optional) of specific works which will be included in the exhibition.
Please make sure each file is under 300MB and less than 5 minutes in length. If the original
video is longer than that, please send an excerpt. Videos should be in MOV, MP4, or AVI
format. Do not include exhibition documentation unless the element of time is integral to
the work (i.e. performance or video installations).
3) A one-page statement describing the concept of the exhibition. The file should be a PDF,
RTF, or Word document.
4) An image list providing an inventory of the images submitted. Include number, artist name,
title, year, medium, and dimensions. Again, make it PDF, RTF, or Word document.
5) Your resume and the resumes of any prospective collaborators.
The Gallery offers residency for 3, 6 and 12 months with an exhibition at the end of the residency, interested artists will be responsible for transport to and from Bulawayo, the gallery will offer subsidised accommodation materials and exhibition space for the 6 to 12 months residency while those applying for the 3 months residency will be the gallery will provide studio and exhibition space artists are expected to cover transport accommodation and material expenses.

Reading is an important act of both finding and performing voice. It relates closely or even synonymously with the act of writing, stringing words together to express ideas in time.
The Readolution will be digitized is set to be a digital anthology by Dibookeng in partnership with the Goethe-Institut which calls on the writer to imagine, to make concrete in time ideas, fictional or real that speak to occupying both space and place. The title is a play on Gil Scott Heron’s powerful song and poem The Revolution will not be Televised – which seeks to purge and critically comment on what kind of revolutions would find space in mainstream shared spaces.
Digitisation is defined as the representation of an object, image, sound, document or a signal by a discrete set of its points or samples. Through this project, we call on writers from Africa and the diaspora to begin and continue to claim the digital space, through both writing and reading, in order to help facilitate conversations and representation of self from our own powerful lived experiences.
‘The revolution will be live’ as Heron reminds us. We extend and agree that indeed, the readolution has the ability to exist in both real and imagined time. It is where we are, it is in what our eyes read from a page that has the power to both revolutionize and represent our thinking.
We invite African writers and the larger diaspora to submit strictly 1000 word pieces both fiction and non-fiction. Diary entries and prose will be given first preference in our search for 10 works that will feature in the African Futures Festival which takes place in Johannesburg from 28 October to 1 November. Each selected work will be awarded a R1000 (South African Rands), helping build our vision of a representative literary space.
The anthology will be available on the Goethe-Institut website for download. Excerpts from the anthology will be available as podcasts on Soundcloud as well.
Original works only. Works must be submitted in English.

Invited are local and international artists whose works discuss the notion of the “PUBLIC” and its complexities.
Deadline of submission is on October 5, 2015.
Artists working in a variety of media and disciplines are invited to participate and submit their works. We are seeking image submissions such as photographic series, video arts, short films, video mapping, recorded public performances, digital manipulation, animation, digital arts, new media arts, and others. Needless to say, any medium that can be projected to the screen will be accepted.
Please email your submissions, together with description, artist statement, and bionote, to themultipleexposureproject@gmail.com.

About the Theme (Public):
The “public” is a multi-layered concept defined differently depending on how the term is used and framed. It is a notion devoid of singularity and is, grammatically speaking, a terrain of contradictions. As a noun and an adjective, the public constitutes the people, masses or community, and suggests anything that is staged, accessed, or seen out in the “open.” The public can also be used as a verb to describe something one does, as in make public or publicize, suggesting the movement or shift from the inside (private) to the outside (public). Paradoxically, however, the same term also points to the limits of such openness and movement. Given that it simultaneously refers to something “involving and provided by the government”, the public is always at risk of becoming merely an apparatus of the sovereign state and its institutions, thus making the flow of its production, distribution, and consumption partial and counterproductive.
With these issues in mind, we are looking for submissions that address and interrogate key topics of interest, but are not limited to, the following:
–
What is public? What counts as public?
–
The public and the private – their overlapping tensions and ambiguities (ex: private event, object, or space made public)
–
The public as a collective (subject, citizenship, nation, etc.)
–
Politics, institutions, and conflicts (of interests) in public sphere
–
Positioning the public in the city or urban context
–
The value of public-ness (openness, sharing, connection, participation, etc.)
–
The limits and potentials of the public
–
The public and the subaltern counterpublic
–
Public image and identity
–
Public performance, gaze, visual voyeurism, and spectacle
–
Public and biopolitics (power, discipline, panopticon, and surveillance)
Description:
As implied by the project’s title, “Outside the White Cube” seeks to re-frame the practice of curating and spectating images outside the exclusionary, institutional borders of the “white cube” or gallery space.
Public spaces are used as an exhibition site to stimulate a mode of spectator experience that revolves around displacement of the passersby (public) from their “habitus” by interrupting the flow of pedestrian traffic. We alter a familiar public space and transform it into an unusual, dialogic site for image projection and exhibition, taking advantage of its accessibility and site-specificity in order to redefine the ways the spectators look at and engage with images. Adopting “guerilla urbanism” as a curatorial strategy, we make sense of the immediacy of the “public” and reflect upon its context, meanings, and intersections with representation, place, and discourse. In so doing, we intervene and reformat aspects of the urban landscapes and emphasize the “counter-spectacle” in art viewing and appreciation.
This project also underlines the inherent ephemerality of an open-to-the-public display in relation to time and space. As a “traveling” exhibition which heavily depends on projection technology and public space as its “frame” or “canvas”, this project celebrates the momentary nature of image-viewing, consumption, and mobility in the metropolis at a time of constant flux and transition.
Sites and Duration:
Selected works will be projected and displayed in public spaces in different parts of Metro Manila where there is a massive flow of human traffic. Possible sites defined by law as “public place” include: “any highway, boulevard, avenue, road, street, bridge or other thoroughfare, park, plaza, square, and/or any open space of public ownership where the people are allowed access.” Each exhibition will run anywhere from a few hours to a week. The first phase of the traveling exhibition will run from October to December 2015. An accompanying zine featuring the works of the artists will also be published.
About The Multiple eXposure Project: The Multiple eXposure Project is a multimedia, multi/trans/inter-disciplinary artistic practice and research-based initiative that explores the many layers of image-making, participatory photography, visual ethnography, and performative encounter(s) between the image and the spectator; the subject and the viewer.

SP-Arte/2016 will take place April 7–10, 2016, with a VIP/Professional Preview on April 6. SP-Arte is the leading art fair in Latin America, presenting the best of modern and contemporary art. Galleries interested in participating in the 2016 edition of SP-Arte can access the online application here.
In 2015, SP-Arte experienced one of its best editions yet, welcoming 140 participating galleries from 17 countries. Visitors included collectors, curators, academics, and museum professionals from around the world. SP-Arte presents one of the most important moments in the art calendar in Brazil: as the German newspaper Die Welt noted, “The artistic life in São Paulo is flourishing as in the golden ’50s, when Oscar Niemeyer’s futuristic buildings were inaugurated in Ibirapuera Park and the Bienal de São Paulo, the second-largest Biennial in the world to date, claimed cultural validity. This week, some feel themselves reminded of Miami when the Art Basel moved there 10 years ago.” (April 2015)
Applicants can choose from one of the following multidisciplinary sections available at SP-Arte:
Main sector: Exhibitors in this sector include prominent Brazilian and International galleries presenting modern and contemporary works in a wide range of mediums, including painting, sculpture, drawing, photograph, mixed media, and more.
Showcase sector: A platform for emerging galleries in which curators, collectors, and the fair public can discover cutting-edge works. Exhibitors in the Showcase sector will have a strong curatorial approach in their gallery program. Participating galleries will be asked to bring a select representation of their works, showing a maximum of three artists in their booths.
Solo sector: Curated by Luiza Teixeira de Freitas, the 2016 Solo sector will see the chosen galleries work closely with the curator on the selection and presentation of a single artist. Luiza Teixeira de Freitas is an independent curator based between London and Lisbon. She has worked for private collections and on various independent projects, is a trustee of the Chisenhale Gallery in London, and serves as a strategic advisor for Delfina Foundation, London.
Open Plan will return in 2016 for its second edition as a curated section dedicated to installations. All galleries accepted into one of the three gallery sectors (Main, Showcase, Solo) may apply to Open Plan in January 2016.
All galleries should have a permanent exhibition space with at least three years of experience. Galleries are encouraged to submit a detailed exhibition project for the Fair that includes a description of the installation and artwork images.
The deadline to submit all applications and necessary documents is October 15.
For additional questions, please contact application@sp-arte.com. All applications will be reviewed by the Fair organizers and Selection Committee and a final list of exhibitors will be announced by December 2015 on SP-Arte’s website.

Applications to Galleries, Edition, Statements, Feature
The Galleries sector is the main exhibition sector of Art Basel, where leading art galleries for modern and contemporary art display 20th- and 21st-century artworks. The galleries in this sector are judged for selection based upon their overall program, while also outlining their specific booth concept for the Basel show.
Edition is the sector for leading publishers of editioned works, prints and multiples. As with the Galleries sector, exhibitors are judged based upon their overall program, while also outlining their specific booth concept.
Statements is the platform for galleries presenting single emerging artists for discovery by the international art world via an exhibition of strongly related works. Preference is given to single projects. Selection is based on the proposal, not on the gallery’s overall activities.
(Please note: To support galleries with a focus on emerging artists, Art Basel has expanded and more clearly defined its guidelines for this sector. Artists who have been spotlighted at other international art fairs—including Art Basel’s other editions—or at major institutions will be considered. However, the proposed artwork must be an entirely new body of work, significantly different from what has been exhibited before in such contexts. As before, the Art Basel in Basel Selection Committee’s preference will continue to be given to projects specifically created for the show in Basel, proposed by emerging artists in the international art world.)
Feature focuses on precisely curated projects, such as the presentation of a single artist of any generation, exceptional art historical material, or exhibitions presenting multiple artists within a curatorial concept. As with Statements, selection is based on the proposal, not the gallery.
Deadline for applications to these sectors is Thursday, September 17, 2015.
Applications to Unlimited and Parcours
Early applications for the Unlimited and Parcours sectors are now possible for projects that require a long production time. Please note that all applications to Unlimited and Parcours will be reviewed only after acceptance into one of the primary sectors (Galleries, Edition, Statements, Feature). It is therefore not possible to apply for Unlimited or Parcours only.
Unlimited is Art Basel’s pioneering exhibition platform for projects that transcend the classical art-show stand, including large-scale sculpture and paintings, video projections, installations, and live performances. Works are selected by the Art Basel in Basel Selection Committee, while New York-based curator Gianni Jetzer is responsible for their presentation.
Parcours engages the city’s historical quarters with sculptures, site-specific installations, interventions, and performances by renowned international artists and emerging talents. Works are selected by the Art Basel in Basel Selection Committee and curated for the first time by Basel-based curator Samuel Leuenberger.
Deadline for early applications to Unlimited and Parcours is Thursday, October 15, 2015.
Applications that are handed in by the October 15 deadline will be reviewed by the Art Basel in Basel Selection Committee, whose decision will be communicated at the beginning of November 2015. The application period for Unlimited and Parcours will then stay open until Friday, January 15, 2016 for further applications, which will be reviewed by the Art Basel in Basel Selection Committee by the end of January 2016.
Read the application material and the exhibition regulations carefully and complete the checklist of required materials. We look forward to receiving your application.
Should you have questions about the application process, please do not hesitate to contact the Art Basel team via applications@artbasel.com.

Invited are emerging scholars in the humanities and interpretive social sciences eager to pursue academic or research careers to join a team of twenty-three scholars and artists who continue to contribute significantly to redefining the study of the humanities and social sciences locally and internationally. For 2016, prospective candidates will be selected in accordance with the research priorities of the National Flagship Project in the Humanities funded through the National Research Foundation and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. These include interests in the broad themes of citizenship, migration and political violence, the human and technology, aesthetic education and museum and heritage studies.
In addition to the awards made through the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and the DST-NRF Flagship, the CHR is also home to the National Research Foundation SARChI Chair in Visual History and Theory. The Chair is offering a number of Doctoral, Masters and Honours scholarships to be taken up in 2016 for full-time postgraduate study, as well as one Post-Doctoral Fellowship. The categories in which awards will be made are:
Migrating Violence
The popular nature of xenophobia, the violence involved in labour disputes on the mines, and the violence of citizenship regarding who belongs, are vivid reminders of how migrancy continues to pose a challenge for critical thought, and provides insights into the nature of political practice and democratic promise in Africa. Through the figure of the “migrant” we wish to understand how instances of violence in South Africa remain embedded in the legacies of colonial citizenship. We invite applications that address themselves centrally to more general dilemmas of citizenship in postcolonial Africa, from a Southern African vantage point.
Aesthetic Education and the Becoming Technical of the Human
What are the outlines of an aesthetic education that constitutes an “aesthetic field” which may open onto other understandings of the concept of the postapartheid and the postcolonial both in and beyond South Africa? What are the shifting dynamics of the relationship between the human and technology in contemporary times that impinge on the debate on aesthetic education? Research projects that explore these questions in relation to arts practice and humanities scholarship and to performance, film, music and puppetry are particularly encouraged.
One masters and one doctoral fellowship in this research area are allocated to candidates working on puppetry, performance and theatre studies specifically. Candidates applying for one of these fellowships should be a practitioner available to mentor emerging artists in these disciplines associated with the Factory of the Arts initiative of the flagship whilst pursuing their research/studies.
NRF SARChI Chair in Visual History and Theory
The Chair in Visual History and Theory promotes innovative research that brings images into larger questions of history and the humanities, and supports new critical directions that engage with visual archives and contemporary theory in the arts and media. A range of fellowships are available that are intended to promote research and build a postgraduate community in this field. These include one post-doctoral fellowship, three doctoral fellowships, two masters, and a number of honours fellowships.
Museum and Heritage Studies
The African Programme in Museum and Heritage Studies (APMHS), which has been offered since 1988, is the leading training and education programme in the field for professionals and scholars in Africa. It is offered at the level of Postgraduate Diploma and as a MA (History) with a specialisation in museum and heritage studies. What makes the APMHS unique is that it emphasises a conceptual understanding of the terrain of public culture, of the challenges of transformation and of the work of representation. The study of museums and the worlds of heritage is approached and conceptualised in a manner that consistently, critically and practically engages with and challenges the dominant ways in which heritage is presented. This enables possibilities of developing an independent and critical public scholarship, and of fostering the emergence of a significant layer of public intellectuals. For further information on requirements for Museum and Heritage Studies Fellowship please contact Vanessa Mitchell via her email address: VanessaD@robben-island.org.za
All those selected to these prestigious fellowship research groups will be required to participate in reading programmes with other recipients of the grant and faculty members. Successful candidates will be required to be present on campus during the relevant academic semesters unless granted leave by the fellowship board. All Postdoctoral fellows will be required to produce at least one peer- reviewed journal article, which when published should contain appropriate acknowledgement of the University of the Western Cape. Postdoctoral Fellows are also required to show substantial progress towards publication of a monograph. The CHR together with the History Department hosts a weekly seminar series where prospective candidates can present their research and solicit valuable feedback from an interdisciplinary forum of academic staff and graduate students. The CHR also convenes regular reading groups, an annual Winter School and colloquia. Fellows are required to actively participate in the seminar series, reading groups, winter school and colloquia. The centre provides office accommodation and access to the UWC – Robben Island Museum Mayibuye Archive collection.
FELLOWSHIP AWARDS
In 2016, fellowships will be offered at masters, doctoral and postdoctoral level in disciplines associated with the humanities. The fellowships are valued at R90 000, R120 000 and R180 000 respectively. The awards cover a monthly stipend, travel costs, accommodation and basic research expenses.
The SARChI Chair in Visual History and Theory offers one postdoctoral fellowship, three doctoral fellowships, two masters fellowships, and a number of honours bursaries. The value of the fellowships will be determined by guidelines set by the NRF and Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.
APPLICATION PROCESS
Candidates must identify the research thematic best suited to their respective research interests. They should provide a brief two-page statement on how the research and study to be undertaken will contribute to the larger national and international debates on the humanities, especially, albeit not exclusively, as these relate to advancing its study in Africa.
All applications should include a CV, a letter of motivation on why the Flagship is the best fit for the study, name the academic department beyond the CHR through which the degree will be pursued, provide an academic writing sample or published journal article, an academic transcript and three independent academic references. Referees’ reports need to be sent directly to the CHR.
Doctoral and postdoctoral applicants are also required to submit a three page description of their research project and a plan of work on the project.
Candidates applying for the master’s fellowship are also required to supply a three page proposal on planned research and a chapter from an honours long paper.
Prospective candidates are invited to browse the flagship’s website for clarification on the CHR’s programmes, offerings, research focus and requirements of the award: www.chrflagship.uwc.ac.za
The fellowship cannot be held concurrently with other fellowships without permission of the Director of the CHR and all recipients of grants will be required to fulfill the obligations of the programme.
The selection process will prioritize the applications of South Africans of historically disadvantaged groups.
All masters and doctoral fellows (including applicants for Museum and Heritage Studies) must make independent application to the relevant academic departments in which the degree will be conferred. The application process is available: www.uwc.ac.za

For 2016, prospective candidates will be selected in accordance with the research priorities of the National Flagship Project in the Humanities funded through the National Research Foundation and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. These include interests in the broad themes of citizenship, migration and political violence, the human and technology, aesthetic education and museum and heritage studies.</p><p>In addition to the awards made through the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and the DST-NRF Flagship, the CHR is also home to the National Research Foundation SARChI Chair in Visual History and Theory. The Chair is offering a number of Doctoral, Masters and Honours scholarships to be taken up in 2016 for full-time postgraduate study, as well as one Post-Doctoral Fellowship. The categories in which awards will be made are:</p><p><strong> Migrating Violence</strong><br> The popular nature of xenophobia, the violence involved in labour disputes on the mines, and the violence of citizenship regarding who belongs, are vivid reminders of how migrancy continues to pose a challenge for critical thought, and provides insights into the nature of political practice and democratic promise in Africa. Through the figure of the “migrant” we wish to understand how instances of violence in South Africa remain embedded in the legacies of colonial citizenship. We invite applications that address themselves centrally to more general dilemmas of citizenship in postcolonial Africa, from a Southern African vantage point.</p><p><strong> Aesthetic Education and the Becoming Technical of the Human</strong><br> What are the outlines of an aesthetic education that constitutes an “aesthetic field” which may open onto other understandings of the concept of the postapartheid and the postcolonial both in and beyond South Africa? What are the shifting dynamics of the relationship between the human and technology in contemporary times that impinge on the debate on aesthetic education? Research projects that explore these questions in relation to arts practice and humanities scholarship and to performance, film, music and puppetry are particularly encouraged.</p><p>One masters and one doctoral fellowship in this research area are allocated to candidates working on puppetry, performance and theatre studies specifically. Candidates applying for one of these fellowships should be a practitioner available to mentor emerging artists in these disciplines associated with the Factory of the Arts initiative of the flagship whilst pursuing their research/studies.</p><p><strong> NRF SARChI Chair in Visual History and Theory</strong><br> The Chair in Visual History and Theory promotes innovative research that brings images into larger questions of history and the humanities, and supports new critical directions that engage with visual archives and contemporary theory in the arts and media. A range of fellowships are available that are intended to promote research and build a postgraduate community in this field. These include one post-doctoral fellowship, three doctoral fellowships, two masters, and a number of honours fellowships.</p><p><strong> Museum and Heritage Studies</strong><br> The African Programme in Museum and Heritage Studies (APMHS), which has been offered since 1988, is the leading training and education programme in the field for professionals and scholars in Africa. It is offered at the level of Postgraduate Diploma and as a MA (History) with a specialisation in museum and heritage studies. What makes the APMHS unique is that it emphasises a conceptual understanding of the terrain of public culture, of the challenges of transformation and of the work of representation. The study of museums and the worlds of heritage is approached and conceptualised in a manner that consistently, critically and practically engages with and challenges the dominant ways in which heritage is presented. This enables possibilities of developing an independent and critical public scholarship, and of fostering the emergence of a significant layer of public intellectuals. For further information on requirements for Museum and Heritage Studies Fellowship please contact Vanessa Mitchell via her email address: <a href=mailto:VanessaD@robben-island.org.za target=_blank>VanessaD@robben-island.org.za</a></p><p>All those selected to these prestigious fellowship research groups will be required to participate in reading programmes with other recipients of the grant and faculty members. Successful candidates will be required to be present on campus during the relevant academic semesters unless granted leave by the fellowship board. All Postdoctoral fellows will be required to produce at least one peer- reviewed journal article, which when published should contain appropriate acknowledgement of the University of the Western Cape. Postdoctoral Fellows are also required to show substantial progress towards publication of a monograph. The CHR together with the History Department hosts a weekly seminar series where prospective candidates can present their research and solicit valuable feedback from an interdisciplinary forum of academic staff and graduate students. The CHR also convenes regular reading groups, an annual Winter School and colloquia. Fellows are required to actively participate in the seminar series, reading groups, winter school and colloquia. The centre provides office accommodation and access to the UWC – Robben Island Museum Mayibuye Archive collection.</p><p><strong>FELLOWSHIP AWARDS</strong></p><p>In 2016, fellowships will be offered at masters, doctoral and postdoctoral level in disciplines associated with the humanities. The fellowships are valued at R90 000, R120 000 and R180 000 respectively. The awards cover a monthly stipend, travel costs, accommodation and basic research expenses.</p><p>The SARChI Chair in Visual History and Theory offers one postdoctoral fellowship, three doctoral fellowships, two masters fellowships, and a number of honours bursaries. The value of the fellowships will be determined by guidelines set by the NRF and Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.</p><p><strong>APPLICATION PROCESS</strong></p><p>Candidates must identify the research thematic best suited to their respective research interests. They should provide a brief two-page statement on how the research and study to be undertaken will contribute to the larger national and international debates on the humanities, especially, albeit not exclusively, as these relate to advancing its study in Africa.</p><p>All applications should include a CV, a letter of motivation on why the Flagship is the best fit for the study, name the academic department beyond the CHR through which the degree will be pursued, provide an academic writing sample or published journal article, an academic transcript and three independent academic references. Referees’ reports need to be sent directly to the CHR.</p><p>Doctoral and postdoctoral applicants are also required to submit a three page description of their research project and a plan of work on the project.</p><p>Candidates applying for the master’s fellowship are also required to supply a three page proposal on planned research and a chapter from an honours long paper.</p><p>Prospective candidates are invited to browse the flagship’s website for clarification on the CHR’s programmes, offerings, research focus and requirements of the award: www.chrflagship.uwc.ac.za</p><p>The fellowship cannot be held concurrently with other fellowships without permission of the Director of the CHR and all recipients of grants will be required to fulfill the obligations of the programme.</p><p>The selection process will prioritize the applications of South Africans of historically disadvantaged groups.</p><p>All masters and doctoral fellows (including applicants for Museum and Heritage Studies) must make independent application to the relevant academic departments in which the degree will be conferred.

Byrd is calling for 1,384 image submissions for a special project.
DEADLINE: October 31st, 2015
What is the role of the image, today, in documenting or communicating social experience and political change? In considering this question for the 10th edition of the biennale the curators will construct and present a dynamic public archive or image repository attesting to how Malians, Africans, and the broader global citizenry have used images to document forms of social or political changes in their lives, as well as images that offer alternative representations of everyday life experiences. In the end, what do we want to visually retain about recent histories, from an individual or collective perspective? The project aims to construct a photographic memory of a world caught in the flow of images.
In 2012 the sovereignty of Mali was threatened not only by rebel nationalists but also by jihadist groups. Taking these upheavals as a starting point, the curators are soliciting amateur and professional images taken between January 16, 2012 and October 31st, 2015. This period forms a chronological span of 1,384 days, or 33,192 hours, or 1,991,520 minutes, or 119,491,200 seconds. These calculations represent the temporal width between two events – the beginning of the insurgency and the beginning of the 10th edition of the biennale. What form might this span of time assume through visual representation?
In addition, we are also accepting images that respond, directly or indirectly, to other major sociopolitical and environmental events on the continent such as the Ebola epidemic, the revolution in Burkina Faso, recent forms of violent religious extremism, and other major events throughout the world occurring during this temporal span.
WHO CAN ENTER?
The project is open to ALL photographers (amateur and professional), and collectives from anywhere in the world. All submitted images must be original work and photographic or lens based.
PRESENTATION
The selected images will be presented for the duration of the biennale from October 31 – December 31, 2015 in a special exhibition included in the official 10th Bamako Encounters programme. In addition, the biennale’s website will also feature a compilation of images that will circulate across social media platforms and form the basis of a virtual archive that will endure beyond the end of the biennale.
IMAGE ENTRY / HOW MANY IMAGES CAN I SUBMIT?
Individual submissions are limited to 2 images, collectives are limited to 5 images. All submissions must be sent to collectingimages@rencontres-bamako.com with the following details provided in the body of the e-mail:
– Place Taken
– Artist/Photographer’s Name
– Country of Origin
– Exact Date of Work, e.g., 3 July 2012 (note: images will not be published without the exact date)
– Short description of each image (maximum of 50 words)
IMAGE QUALITY / LABEL

2. Each image must be labeled with the photographer’s name, date, and location in which the image was taken, for example:
“john_doe_4_3_2014_bamako.jpg” or “jane_doe_5_13_2015_krakow.jpg”

The conference organised by Dr. Dorothy Price and Dr. Elizabeth Robles will take place on March 21 , 2016.
‘It is simply too early to try to define the 1980s as a closed or finished period… It is still unresolved and very much ongoing.’
Kobena Mercer, ‘Iconography After Identity’ (2005)
The Black Arts Movement was generated by the tumult of the 1980s – a decade defined as much by Thatcherism, civil unrest and race riots as by the rise of cultural theory and so-called ‘single issue’ social movements. It aimed to transform the nature and perception of British art and its histories. Under its banner, a constellation of artists and critics from a wide range of diasporic backgrounds worked around, and through, questions of ‘Blackness’ in Britain. They interrogated the possibilities and implications of Black British Art and its relationship to other forms of creative production, popular culture and transnational modernisms more broadly.
This conference will examine the ways in which the dialogues and discourses initiated by the Black Arts Movement are, as Kobena Mercer reminds us, unresolved and ongoing. It will continue to unpack and unpick questions around the efficacy and outcomes of the tenuously labeled Movement and reflect on the ways in which this period, only thirty short years ago, has become historicized (or not). It also aims to push debate forward, to ask how the aesthetic, historical, methodological and/or critical threads of the ‘critical decade’ wind through the 1990s and beyond; to address the rise of globalization, multiculturalism, digital networks and technologies, developments in the bio-sciences and post-racial debates to the playful posturing of the YBAs and an increasingly transnational art scene.
Proposals are invited for papers covering any aspect of Black British Art (before and after the 1980s) and the Black Arts Movement, from scholars working in all fields of creative and visual culture. Topics might include, but are not limited to:
– The global/the local
– History and myth
– The canon/canonicity
– Art, science, and technology
– Exhibitions
– Archives
– The relationship between art and literature
– Gender and the body
– Before the Black Arts Movement
– Fashion/Style/Dress
Please send proposals along with a brief biography to Dr. Elizabeth Robles (haekr@bristol.ac.uk) before 1 November, 2015.

The investments are focused on projects, networks and platforms that have a shared interest in building a stronger regional creative fabric.
Ant funding addresses two different types of initiative through micro-grants:
Ant Project Funding for transnational initiatives involving collaboration, exchange and mobility of artists and work (up to ZAR 60 000/US$ 5000). Visit this page to apply
Ant Research Residencies enabling research, networking and project development (up to ZAR 47 000/US$ 4000). See below to apply
ANT research residencies/project development grants:
Research residencies are available to artists, curators, and arts managers to undertake research trips of between 1 and 4 weeks duration within the SADC region. The purpose of the funding is to provide an opportunity for creative producers and organisers to develop collaborative projects and initiatives with peers operating in the region and enjoy the benefits of face to face engagement and a substantive experience of a different context/environment for creative work.
The same broad guidelines and exclusions for Ant project funding apply to research residency grants, and the geographical scope is the same (Angola, Botswana, Democratic Republic of Congo, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Seychelles, Tanzania (including Zanzibar), Zambia, and Zimbabwe).

The motivation should also include reference to any history of engagement with the context that you would be visiting.
•a summary budget addressing your travel, visa, accommodation and per diem costs for the residency. Up to ZAR 47 000/US$ 4000 will be made available for each residency. Your budget should also include reference to any other financial contributions to the residency and/or in-kind contributions that a local partner or partners might make (for example, the provision of accommodation) in support of your residency, though this is not mandatory.
•a short professional biography (approximately 250 words is adequate) and a short relevant CV.
•(all projects should be completed by end December 2016)

Breaking a taboo is less of an issue today than in the past. The speed with which societies are changing, requires constant questioning of what is considered acceptable. Taboo-breaking and taboo-creating are the inevitable results of our hyper-active times.
Globalisation catapults attitudes into every corner of the globe, and forces indigenous populations, groups or persons to respond, often in totally unprepared cultural contexts, to confront or accept new associations once unimaginable or forbidden. These conflict with traditional or deeply entrenched ways of thinking, which historically have often been held fast by taboos.
In this context, artists are in the most enviable position. They are free in the widest sense, able to dissent and ask questions, and in their practice create new worlds which transgress the old. By exploring such issues as death, marriage, sexuality, money, racism, freedom, religion, gender, war, violence, politics, or behavioral traits such as guilt, shame, love, exploitation, forgiveness, artists can turn taboo-related themes on their heads, in subtle or explicit ways which are dissimilating but illuminating or shocking but liberating.
Works submitted can take into account prevailing taboos, wherever and however they are experienced, geographically or culturally, or give a sense of how and why transitions to new forms of consideration and acceptance are given with taboos.
Works or projects can be in any media, from performance to documentation, to installation, photography, video and painting. Works will be selected for their ability to spark thoughtful investigation on the taboo in question, as well as revealing how aesthetics can advance understanding on the subject being treated.
Finalist works will be chosen by the directors of Galleria Poggiali & Forconi, who will be hosting the final exhibition in their two spaces in Florence, Italy, 15-30 March 2016. This is an opportunity to show your artwork and work alongside one of Italy’s top art galleries.
Prize winners will be chosen by the finalist artists themselves in a secret vote which will be held on the exhibition’s opening night in March 2016.
Enter your work or project in any medium on the theme by 5 December 2015.
Entry fee: one work 20 €, a project (up to 10 works) 70 €.

By exploring such issues as death, marriage, sexuality, money, racism, freedom, religion, gender, war, violence, politics, or behavioral traits such as guilt, shame, love, exploitation, forgiveness, artists can turn taboo-related themes on their heads, in subtle or explicit ways which are dissimilating but illuminating or shocking but liberating.</p><p>Works submitted can take into account prevailing taboos, wherever and however they are experienced, geographically or culturally, or give a sense of how and why transitions to new forms of consideration and acceptance are given with taboos.</p><p>Works or projects can be in any media, from performance to documentation, to installation, photography, video and painting. Works will be selected for their ability to spark thoughtful investigation on the taboo in question, as well as revealing how aesthetics can advance understanding on the subject being treated.</p><p>Finalist works will be chosen by the directors of Galleria Poggiali &amp; Forconi, who will be hosting the final exhibition in their two spaces in Florence, Italy, 15-30 March 2016. This is an opportunity to show your artwork and work alongside one of Italy’s top art galleries.</p><p>Prize winners will be chosen by the finalist artists themselves in a secret vote which will be held on the exhibition’s opening night in March 2016.</p><p>Enter your work or project in any medium on the theme by <strong>5 December 2015</strong>.</p><p>Entry fee: one work 20 €, a project (up to 10 works) 70 €.</p><p>Full details on the theme and how to enter: <a href=http://www.celesteprize.com/Taboo2015/ target=_blank>http://www.celesteprize.com/Taboo2015/</a></p><p><a href=http://www.celesteprize.com/Taboo2015/ target=_blank>www.celesteprize.com</a></p><p> </p></div>"
